    "React as a runtime for UI = f(state): pure components, immutable element trees, reconciliation, hooks as positional state, effects as synchronization, and concurrent rendering — derived from the model and proved where provable, not memorized as API folklore. Gates demand transfer: predict render behavior, diagnose stale closures, justify memoization soundness, and design state machines under a strict reviewer rubric.",
  overview:
    "React is the dominant way user interfaces get built, and it is routinely taught as an API catalogue: components, props, useState, useEffect, and a list of rules to memorize. Taught that way, its behavior seems arbitrary — renders fire 'too often', closures go stale, effects loop — and debugging becomes guesswork. This course teaches React as what it actually is: a **runtime for the equation UI = f(state)**, from which every rule follows as a consequence.\n\nThree pillars organize everything. **Purity**: components are pure functions from props and state to immutable descriptions of UI (element trees) — rendering computes a description and never mutates the world. **Reconciliation**: React compares the new description against the old under an O(n) heuristic and commits a minimal set of real mutations, which is why keys and component identity govern what survives a render. **Scheduling**: state updates are queued and batched, rendering can be paused and resumed (Fiber), and effects synchronize the pure world with everything outside it.\n\nThe arc: units 1–3 build the core model — the render/commit cycle, reconciliation and identity, and state-as-snapshot semantics. Units 4–6 put behavior on a sound footing: designing state so illegal states are unrepresentable, hooks as positional storage (and the theorem that makes the Rules of Hooks necessary rather than stylistic), and effects as synchronization with their dependency and cleanup discipline. Units 7–10 scale the model to production: the re-render cost model and memoization soundness, concurrent rendering and tearing, data fetching with Suspense and the server, and types, tests, and error boundaries.\n\nProvable claims are proved — the tree-diff complexity gap, update-queue fold semantics, the stale-closure theorem, the fetch-race interleavings — rather than asserted as folklore. By the end you should be able to predict render behavior before running the code, diagnose stale closures and identity bugs from the model, justify every memoization you add, and design component state like the state machine it is. The gates grade exactly that transfer.",

Purity is the load-bearing contract: because rendering only computes and never mutates, React is free to render twice, discard work, or pause it — every later feature (batching, concurrency, memoization) is licensed by this contract. The gate asks you to predict pipeline behavior from the model, which is this course's standing demand.",

              "body": "Before React, the dominant model for browser UI was **imperative mutation**: when something happens, find the DOM nodes affected and edit them by hand. A login form might disable the submit button while a request is in flight, swap a spinner in, clear an error banner from the previous attempt, and re-enable the button on failure — each of those is a hand-written mutation, and each must be written *for every path that can reach it*. The trouble is combinatorial. A screen whose appearance depends on n independent boolean facts (loading? logged in? error present? cart empty?) has up to 2ⁿ visually distinct states, and an imperative program does not write states — it writes **transitions**. Every event handler must know how to convert *whatever the screen currently shows* into what it should show next. Miss one path — an error banner left up after a retry succeeds — and you get the classic stale-UI bug: not a crash, just a screen quietly lying about the state of the world. The core insight behind React is that the transition-writing burden is the thing to eliminate. If the programmer instead supplies a single function that maps *any* state to its correct appearance, transitions stop being the programmer's problem: the runtime computes them by comparing descriptions. That refactoring of responsibility — you own the states, the runtime owns the transitions — is the entire subject of this course, and it has a precise cost model."

              "name": "State coverage beats transition coverage",
              "statement": "Consider a UI whose appearance is determined by a state drawn from a finite set S. An **imperative** implementation must supply correct mutation code for every reachable ordered transition (s, s′) — up to |S|·(|S|−1) cases — because the code that runs on an event depends on both the current screen and the target state. A **declarative** implementation must supply a rendering function f defined on each state — exactly |S| cases — plus a generic differ that turns (f(s), f(s′)) into mutations. Hence the specification burden falls from O(|S|²) to O(|S|), and for a UI driven by n independent booleans, from O(4ⁿ) to O(2ⁿ).",
              "proof": "In the imperative model, the screen is a mutable data structure whose contents are the *accumulated result of past edits*. An event handler firing in state s must issue edits that transform the concrete DOM produced by s into the DOM required by s′; an edit sequence correct for (s₁, s′) is not in general correct for (s₂, s′), because the nodes present differ (the spinner exists in one, not the other). So correctness must be established per ordered pair of (reachable) states: up to |S|·(|S|−1) obligations. In the declarative model, f is a function of s alone; establishing f correct on each of the |S| states discharges every obligation, because for any transition the runtime computes the edit script from the two descriptions f(s) and f(s′) — a single generic algorithm written once (Unit 2). With n independent booleans, |S| = 2ⁿ, so the obligations fall from Θ(2ⁿ·2ⁿ) = Θ(4ⁿ) to Θ(2ⁿ). The exponential in |S| remains — declarative UI does not shrink your state space, it removes the *quadratic blowup on top of it*. ∎"

Concretely, you write components — plain functions — that accept the current data and return a *description* of what the UI should look like. You never tell React *what changed*; you tell it *what everything should be now*, and it works out the change. This is why experienced React code contains almost no verbs about the DOM — no `appendChild`, no `classList.toggle`, no `input.value =`. Those verbs still happen, but they are emitted by the runtime as the computed difference between two descriptions. The rest of this lesson pins down what that description is, because everything later — reconciliation, memoization, concurrency — is defined in terms of it."

A **component** is the function itself — `CartRow` — a reusable recipe that, given props, returns an element tree. An **element** is one immutable description produced by that recipe’s *call site* — `<CartRow qty={2} />` — cheap, disposable, re-created on every render. An **instance** is the runtime's persistent bookkeeping for an element that has been rendered into the tree: its current state, its host DOM node, its position. You write components; render produces elements; React manages instances. Notice what this division implies: because elements are re-created every render, *element identity carries no information* — `<CartRow />` from this render and `<CartRow />` from the last one are different objects. Persistence lives entirely in instances, and React decides which old instance each new element corresponds to. That correspondence problem is reconciliation, and it is why `key` exists. Notice also that `CartRow` appears as a bare reference in `type` — React calls it, you never do. Writing `CartRow({ qty: 2 })` instead of `<CartRow qty={2} />` skips instance bookkeeping entirely and breaks hooks (Unit 5)."

Two observations do real work later. First, the `Star` element is a *description of a call React has not made yet* — `Badge` returned without `Star` running; React will call `Star` only if this subtree is actually rendered. Rendering is therefore **lazy, top-down evaluation**: each component unfolds one layer of the tree, and React drives the recursion. Second, with `pro: false` the children array is `['Ada', false]` — booleans, `null`, and `undefined` are legal children that render to nothing, which is exactly what makes the `cond && <X />` idiom well-defined rather than a special case."

Touching the DOM is orders of magnitude heavier: style recalculation, layout, paint, composite. React spends the cheap currency (object allocation, comparison) to conserve the expensive one (DOM mutation). Immutability is what makes the comparison side cheap: because an element can never change after creation, *reference equality is a complete proof of sameness* — if `oldChild === newChild`, React can skip that entire subtree without looking inside it, a bailout you will exploit deliberately in Unit 7. If elements were mutable, `===` would prove nothing, and every optimization built on it would be unsound.

The returned element tree names further components in type fields; React recurses into each child component (calling it in turn) until the tree bottoms out in host elements only. On the initial mount this visits the whole app; on updates React starts at the components whose state changed and descends from there. The phase is, by contract, side-effect free and produces one value: the next description of the UI.\n\n**Commit phase.** React compares the new description with the previous one (reconciliation, Unit 2) and applies the computed difference to the host tree — for the initial mount, that difference is 'create everything' (appendChild); for updates, the minimal mutation set. Refs are attached and effects run after this point (Unit 6). Then React yields; the browser paints on its own schedule."

When React calls `App` and receives `<Layout><Feed /></Layout>`, only `App` has run. `Layout` and `Feed` are references sitting in type fields — un-called functions. React now calls `Layout` with `children` already set to the `Feed` *element*; if `Layout` returns `<main>{children}</main>`, then `Feed` still hasn't run — it was passed through as opaque data. Only when React reaches the `Feed` element in its traversal does `Feed` execute. Two consequences. First, a component cannot know or care what its children render — composition is opaque, which is what makes `children`-based APIs (and a key performance pattern in Unit 7) possible. Second, the unit of work is naturally a single component call, and the traversal between calls is bookkeeping the runtime owns — which is precisely the seam Fiber exploits to pause and resume rendering (Unit 8)."

              "statement": "Let f be the render phase over components satisfying the purity contract (same inputs ⇒ same returned elements; no side effects during render; no mutation of pre-existing values — Lesson 3). Then executing the render phase k ≥ 1 times on the same inputs before a single commit is observationally equivalent to executing it once: the committed host mutations, and every program-visible value, are identical.",
              "proof": "Two things could distinguish k renders from one: effects observable *during* the renders, or a difference in the tree that commit applies. (1) By the contract, a rendering component performs no I/O, no host mutation, and no writes to pre-existing memory; the only products of a render are freshly allocated elements unreachable by other code until React uses them. Discarded render output is therefore garbage, never observed. (2) By input-determinism, each of the k renders receives the same props and state and returns structurally identical trees; commit consumes only the final tree, and reconciliation is a deterministic function of (previous committed tree, new tree), so the mutation set is the same as in the single-render execution. Hence no observer — user, DOM, or program — can distinguish the two executions. ∎\n\nThis small theorem is the license for a remarkable amount of machinery: StrictMode can double-invoke components in development to *detect* contract violations (a pure component can't tell); concurrent React can start rendering, throw the work away, and start again (Unit 8); and React can render subtrees speculatively or on the server. Every one of those features is sound *only* for components where this theorem's hypothesis holds — which is why the contract is enforced culturally and tooled aggressively."

Commit has no previous tree, so the diff degenerates to creation: React creates the button node, sets its listeners and text, and appends it to the root container. Effects (if any) run; browser paints '0'.\n\n**Update** (user clicks): the click handler calls `setCount(1)` — the trigger. Render phase calls Counter again; *the entire function body re-executes* — a fresh handler closure, a fresh element — and returns a button element with text '1'. Commit diffs the two button descriptions: same type, same position, so the existing DOM button is kept, and the only mutation is the text node `0 → 1`. Note what did **not** happen: the button was not removed and re-added (it keeps focus — press Enter repeatedly and it stays focused), and nothing else in the document was touched.

During commit, React applies only the difference between descriptions — usually a tiny set of mutations. So 'unnecessary re-render' and 'unnecessary DOM work' are different diseases with different costs: the first burns JavaScript time computing a description that turns out equal (often acceptable — descriptions are cheap, per Lesson 1); the second almost never happens under React precisely because the diff filters it out. When you profile later, this is why the question is always 'is render time itself the bottleneck?' rather than 'is React thrashing the DOM?' — the pipeline design already spent the engineering budget to make the second question boring."

(2) Absolutely no side effects — a network request or subscription in a component body will fire on every render, and the idempotence theorem's guarantees evaporate the moment its hypothesis is violated.

First, **atomicity**: because no mutations happen until the whole new tree is computed, the user never observes a half-updated screen — commit applies one consistent description. Second, **discardability**: a render that has made no mutations can be abandoned at zero cost — the precondition for time-slicing, for prioritizing an urgent update over a half-finished slow one, and for StrictMode's diagnostic double render; the idempotence theorem is exactly the statement that abandonment is safe. Third, **batching**: multiple state updates can be coalesced into one render pass and one commit, because triggering doesn't render immediately (Unit 3 gives the queue semantics). Every 'advanced' React feature you will meet is a dividend of this one design decision — which is why this course teaches the pipeline before any API."

Under the original code the input element description was identical across renders, so commit never touched the node and the browser state survived.

If you can express logic here as plain derivation, do; it needs no lifecycle management at all. **Event handlers**: code that runs because *the user did something* — submit the form, start the purchase, setState. Handlers are not called during render (they're attached, then invoked by real events later), so they may freely perform side effects; they are the *default* home for effects with a clear cause. **Effects** (useEffect, Unit 6): code that must run because *rendering happened* — synchronizing an external system (subscription, widget, document.title) with committed state. The classic mistake is promotion in the wrong direction: reaching for an effect for what is really event logic, or doing during render what belongs after commit. A useful interrogation for any impure line: *what is the actual cause of this work?* User action ⇒ handler. Being on screen in this state ⇒ effect. Neither ⇒ it is probably derivable, and belongs in render as a pure computation."

It converts a class of rare, timing-dependent production bugs — double-fired requests on interrupted renders, inflating counters, cross-request leaks on the server — into loud, deterministic development bugs. Note its limits, though: it detects impurity that doubling exposes; it cannot prove purity (a component reading Date.now() renders 'consistently' twice in the same millisecond), which is why the contract is a discipline, not a linted guarantee."

Downward-only flow means any on-screen fact has a single authoritative owner, so debugging is tracing a value up to its owner rather than reconstructing a mutation history across the tree — the imperative stale-UI bug from Lesson 1 structurally cannot occur because nobody accumulates screen state by edits. Props immutability is also what makes *props comparison* meaningful: React.memo and every bailout check works by comparing previous and next props (Unit 7); if a child could mutate the object it received, 'previous props' would be corrupted retroactively and comparison would be garbage-in-garbage-out. When a child needs to change data, the pattern is always the same: the owner passes down the value *and a function that requests a change*; the child reports events upward, the owner decides, new props flow down.

The first chart renders and flips scale to 'log' — *on the shared object*. The second chart, whose data did not need it, now renders logarithmic too: a spooky action-at-a-distance where chart A's data changes chart B's axes. Worse, the corruption is order-dependent — it depends on which chart renders first — and StrictMode's double render makes it appear and disappear. The honest versions: derive without mutating (`const scale = needsLog(data) ? 'log' : opts.scale;`) or copy at the boundary (`const local = { ...opts, scale: 'log' };`).

Keys stop being folklore and become what they are: identity declarations that control whether state is preserved or destroyed. Which exposes the unit's deepest point: state lives at a position in the tree, not inside your component function. The gate poses reconciliation puzzles and asks you to predict what survives.",

What commit wants is an **edit script**: a sequence of insertions, deletions, and in-place updates that transforms the old tree into the new one, ideally a short one. This is a well-studied problem in its exact form — and the exact form turns out to be *unaffordable*, which is the single most important fact about React's reconciler. React does not compute the optimal edit script. It computes a good-enough script under two structural assumptions about UIs, in linear time, and exposes one escape hatch — `key` — for the only case where the assumptions need your help. This lesson establishes the gap between the exact problem and React's heuristic precisely, because every reconciliation behavior you will ever observe (state resets, list bugs, remount storms) is a direct consequence of which corners the heuristic cuts."

An **edit script** is a sequence of operations transforming T₁ into T₂, drawn from: **delete** a node (its children are promoted to the parent), **insert** a node (capturing a contiguous run of siblings as its children), and **relabel** a node (change its label in place). Each operation has unit cost. The **tree edit distance** δ(T₁, T₂) is the minimum total cost over all edit scripts, and an optimal differ is one that outputs a script of cost δ(T₁, T₂). With n = |T₁| + |T₂|, the classical dynamic-programming algorithm of Zhang & Shasha runs in O(n⁴) in the worst case; the decomposition algorithm of Demaine, Mozes, Rossman & Weimann achieves O(n³) worst case and is optimal among its algorithm family; and Bringmann et al. (2018) showed no strongly subcubic algorithm exists unless the All-Pairs Shortest Paths conjecture fails."

An O(n³) algorithm performs on the order of 10¹¹ elementary steps — minutes of CPU time — *per state update*, for a UI that must respond in 16 milliseconds to animate at 60 frames per second. Even the O(n²)-ish behavior Zhang–Shasha exhibits on shallow trees is 2.5 × 10⁷ steps per keystroke, spent before a single mutation is applied. And the conditional lower bound says this is not a failure of cleverness: cubic is essentially the price of *optimality*, full stop. The conclusion React's designers drew is the correct engineering response to a hardness result: **change the problem**. Give up minimality; demand linearity; and choose the corners to cut using domain knowledge about how real UIs actually change between frames. The domain knowledge crystallized into two assumptions, and the entire reconciler follows from them."

(b) React's reconciliation — compare roots; if types differ, replace the subtree wholesale; if types match, update the node in place and recurse on the children lists, matching siblings positionally or by key — performs O(n) node comparisons total.",
              "proof": "(a) Adversary argument: suppose a differ examines fewer than n/2 nodes on some input pair (T, T). An adversary runs the differ on (T, T′) where T′ equals T except at one unexamined node, whose label is changed. The differ's execution is identical on both pairs (it never reads the differing node), so it emits the same script for both — but the correct outputs differ (empty script vs at least one relabel). Contradiction; correctness forces reading essentially the whole input. (b) The heuristic touches each pair of matched nodes exactly once: root comparison is O(1); a type mismatch prunes the entire subtree pair with no further comparisons (replacement needs no inspection of descendants beyond construction, which is proportional to the new subtree's size — chargeable to output); a type match costs O(1) plus recursion into children, where positional matching is a single zip of the two child lists and keyed matching builds one hash map of old keys (O(children)) and probes it once per new child (O(1) amortized each). Every node of both trees is charged O(1), so total work is O(n). The heuristic therefore meets the lower bound: linear is not merely fast, it is optimal for any correct differ, once minimality of the script is abandoned. ∎"

The bet: in real UIs, when the type at a position changes, the subtrees are semantically unrelated, and hunting for coincidental structural overlap (which the optimal algorithm would do, at cubic price) buys nothing users care about. **Assumption 2 — the developer can mark identity across renders with `key`.** Within a sibling list, React cannot know whether you inserted at the head or relabeled every row: both hypotheses explain the observation. Rather than solve an alignment problem, React lets the *author* declare identity — `key` is the developer asserting 'this child is the same logical entity as the old child with the same key'. Between the two assumptions, matching becomes local and constant-time per node: types gate subtree reuse, keys resolve sibling alignment, and nothing else is ever compared. What is given up is real: a subtree *moved* to a different parent is never recognized as a move (it is deleted and rebuilt — state lost), and cross-level or cross-type overlap is invisible.

The exact problem has a hardness result; the engineering response is to identify which instances *actually occur* and solve those well.

When the claim holds, the heuristic's script is near-optimal and computed three orders of magnitude faster.

State correctness: instance at position i keeps its state (the type matched), but its props now describe entity i−1 — every stateful row is misaligned by one. The last position pairs old row n−1 against nothing new... rather, new length n+1 exceeds old length n, so one mount occurs at the tail — the 'new row' React perceives is at the *end*, not the head, compounding the misalignment. (b) Keyed matching builds the old map {k₁…kₙ} and probes each new child: the head row's key is absent — one mount; each retained key hits, with props identical to before (same entity, same data), so the update is a no-op and, where element references are shared, subtrees bail out entirely.

And here is the fact this whole lesson unpacks: React associates instance to component *by position in the render tree*, exactly the way reconciliation matches nodes. State does not belong to 'the Counter component' or to 'this JSX tag in the source code'; it belongs to *an address* — 'the Counter rendered as the second child of this section' (with key refining the address among siblings). When successive renders put the same type at the same address, reconciliation matches them, and the address's state persists. When they don't, the instance at that address is destroyed — state and all — and any 'new' appearance elsewhere is a fresh instance.

Consequently: (1) same type, same position ⇒ same instance, state preserved — *even if the JSX came from a different source location or branch of a conditional*; (2) different type at a position ⇒ the old instance and its entire subtree's instances are destroyed, and state below the mismatch is lost — *even if deeper descendants are identical*; (3) a changed key at the same position ⇒ treated as a different address: old instance destroyed, new one mounted; (4) a subtree rendered at a different position (moved across parents, or re-parented by adding/removing a wrapper) ⇒ new address, fresh state."

The two JSX expressions in your source are irrelevant: React never sees your source, only the returned element stream. If you *want* separate scores per player, that is an identity decision, and by Lesson 2 you write it as identity: `<Counter key={person} person={person}/>` — now the address differs per player and each has independent state.\n\n**Case B — same everything, one extra wrapper.** Changing `{fancy ? <div className=\"gold\"><Counter/></div> : <Counter/>}` — toggling fancy DOES reset the counter, both directions. With fancy true, Counter's address is root → div → child 0; with fancy false it is root → child 0.

Defining G inside F means each call of F evaluates the function expression anew, producing a fresh function object G_t on render t. The element <G_t/> at some position is compared against the previous render's <G_{t−1}/> at the same position: same source text, but G_t !== G_{t−1}, so the types differ. By the state-identity rule (clause 2), the old instance is destroyed and a new one mounted — on every render of F. No key can help (keys refine the address; the type test already failed) and memoizing G with useMemo merely stabilizes one render's function object until F's next render recreates it unless dependencies never change — at which point the code is a worse spelling of a top-level component. The only fix is structural: define components at module top level (or hoist G out and pass data via props), making the function object — and thus the type — stable across F's renders. ∎"

The user must click back into the field per keystroke. The fix is purely structural — hoist EmailField to module scope (passing email/setEmail as props), or inline the input directly.

That is n real prop-updates (Θ(n)), each triggering a row re-render. The length mismatch appears at the tail, so the single mount happens at position n — React believes a row was APPENDED. Instance-held state (input drafts, toggles) remains at its position while props shift by one: every stateful row now renders entity i−1's data against entity i's state — total misalignment. Keyed: build map {key→instance} of old rows (O(n) but no mutations); probe each new child: X's key misses ⇒ one mount; every retained key hits with props identical to last render (same entity, same data) ⇒ no-op update, and reference-equal elements bail out entirely.

Fix: key={task.id} — instances then follow entities; deleting a row orphans exactly its key (that instance unmounts, taking its state), and other rows are untouched. If the backend provides no id, mint one at data creation (not render). Symptom 2: the extracted SearchField is defined inside the list component's body, so each parent render evaluates a new function object; reconciliation compares types by reference, sees a 'different type' at the same address every render, and remounts the field — the DOM input is destroyed and recreated per keystroke, so browser-held focus/caret die (the data may survive if lifted, which is why 'only focus' breaks). useCallback/memo cannot make a per-render function a stable type without freezing its closure (stale state).

A render's state is a constant — every closure created during that render sees the same frozen values, which is why calling setCount three times moves the count once, and why 'my state is stale' is usually a correct program being read with the wrong model. The update queue explains what setState actually does: enqueue a replacement or an updater function, folded left to right into the next snapshot when the batch flushes. Immutability completes the model: React detects change by reference comparison, so mutation is invisible to it by construction — and structural sharing is how you produce new snapshots affordably. Three lessons, one theme: state transitions are values, not effects. The gate makes you trace them exactly.",

It does no such thing, and the difference is the source of a whole genus of bugs — handlers that read stale values, intervals that never advance, async code that acts on a world that has moved on. What `setCount` actually does is *request a new render whose snapshot will differ*; it changes nothing at all in the render that called it. The precise model: every render of a component is a **snapshot** — React calls your function with the state values *as of that render*, your JSX closes over those values, and so do your event handlers and effects created during it. The variables `count`, `items`, `user` in a component body are not live views onto some mutable store; they are **per-render constants**, frozen at the moment React called your function. When the requested render happens, React calls your function *again*, producing a new snapshot with new constants — and, crucially, new closures. The old render's handlers still exist (the DOM may still fire them, timeouts may still call them) and they still see the old constants, forever. Once this model is explicit, the classic surprises stop being surprises and become one-line derivations, which is exactly what this lesson practices."

(1) Within render t, the state variable is a constant binding whose value is sₜ: no code running in render t — the body, JSX expressions, or any closure created during render t (event handlers, effect functions, timeout callbacks) — can ever observe a value other than sₜ through that variable. (2) Calling the setter during render t does not change the binding; it enqueues an update and (if the resulting state differs) schedules render t+1, which creates a *fresh* binding holding sₜ₊₁. Consequently, code from render t that runs *after* render t+1 committed still reads sₜ — by design, not by staleness accident.",
              "proof": "This is JavaScript closure semantics applied to React's calling convention, not a special React mechanism. Each render is one invocation of the component function; `const [count, setCount] = useState(…)` declares a local `const` initialized from React's stored state for this instance (Unit 5 shows the storage). A `const` local cannot be reassigned, and `setCount` does not attempt to — it writes to React's store and schedules work. Any function created during this invocation closes over this invocation's lexical environment (ECMA-262 lexical scoping): its references to `count` resolve to *this* binding, permanently — closures capture bindings, and this binding is never mutated. A later render is a new invocation with a new environment and a new `count` binding reading the updated store; nothing connects the two bindings. Hence (1) and (2), and the corollary: a callback from render t executing after later renders still resolves `count` to render t's binding, value sₜ. ∎"

Apply the proposition: within this render, `count` is the constant 0. The handler therefore executes `setCount(0 + 1)` three times — three requests to *replace* state with 1. The queue processes them (next lesson formalizes how): replace-with-1, replace-with-1, replace-with-1 → next snapshot is 1, not 3. There is no moment at which the first setCount 'takes effect' and makes the second one see 1 — that sentence is meaningless in the snapshot model, because `count` is not a variable that setCount writes to; it is a constant of the current invocation. The three calls were three identical instructions computed from the same frozen value. (If you *want* increment-by-three, you say 'increment' rather than 'replace with the value I computed from my snapshot': `setCount(c => c + 1)` three times — the updater form receives the in-progress value; Lesson 2 proves exactly why.)"

So by the time a user *can* click, the handler that will run is the newest committed one, reading the newest committed snapshot — which is why UIs feel 'live' despite all this freezing. The frozen-snapshot behavior surfaces only when a closure from render t *escapes* the render→commit cycle and runs later on its own schedule: timeouts, intervals, promise continuations, subscription callbacks, and — critically — effect functions (Unit 6). Those escaped closures are time capsules. The discipline that follows: when writing any callback that will run 'later', consciously decide which semantics the feature needs — *the world as of the triggering event* (snapshot: use the captured values, you have them already) or *the world as of execution time* (latest: you must arrange access explicitly — updater functions for state, refs for reads, Unit 6).

Every tick executes `setN(0 + 1)`. Tick 1: state 0 → 1, re-render — but the *new* render's snapshot is irrelevant to the old closure, which keeps firing `setN(1)`. Ticks 2, 3, 4…: replace-1, replace-1 — and since the update leaves state unchanged (Object.is(1, 1)), React bails out and doesn't even re-render (Lesson 3 pins this down). Display: 0, then 1, forever. Two honest fixes, matching the two semantics: **updater form** — `setN(c => c + 1)` asks React for 'current + 1' at processing time, no snapshot involved; or **re-synchronize** — put `n` in the deps so each render tears down the old interval and starts one closing over the fresh snapshot (correct but churns the timer; Unit 6 weighs these).

Keep the phenomenon and the judgment separate: Unit 6 needs that precision when dependency arrays make the same physics load-bearing for effects."

So both pass the if. Fixes: (1) synchronous, render-independent guard — a ref: if (inFlightRef.current) return; inFlightRef.current = true; refs are mutable shared cells, not snapshots (Unit 6), so click 2 reads click 1's write immediately; also disable the button as defense-in-depth.

This lesson specifies the machinery that services requests, because its exact semantics are observable and exam-grade predictable. When you call a setter, React does not render immediately. It appends an **update** to a per-state-cell queue and schedules processing. All setter calls made synchronously within one event handler (and, since React 18, within timeouts, promises, and native handlers too) are **batched**: they accumulate in queues, and React processes everything in a single render pass when the handler completes. Two consequences before any formalism. First, calling a setter n times costs one re-render, not n — you may write natural code (set three pieces of state in a row) without performance guilt. Second, and less obviously: because processing is deferred, *what you enqueue matters*. React distinguishes two kinds of update — 'replace the value with v' (you passed a value) and 'transform the value by f' (you passed a function) — and they compose entirely differently once queued. The rest of the lesson is the algebra of that queue, which is small enough to state exactly and rich enough to explain every batching puzzle you will meet."

With value calls: each setter call evaluated n + 1 in the handler's scope, where n is the frozen snapshot s (Lesson 1's proposition), so every enqueued update is replace(s+1); the fold ends at s + 1 whatever k ≥ 1 is. (3) Direct evaluation: fold(0, [replace 6, +1, replace 42]): 0→6→7→42. fold(0, [+1, replace 6, +1]): 0→1→6→7. ∎"

The updater sees the accumulated 5, not the snapshot 0 — this is the precise sense in which updater functions read 'in-progress' state that the render's constants cannot show you. **Puzzle 3:** `setN(c => c + 1); setN(n + 5); setN(c => c + 1);` → [+1, replace 5, +1] → 0→1→5→**6** — the first updater's work is absorbed by the replace; only the second survives.

In the click handler above, there is provably no committed frame in which `count` advanced but `flag` did not — the queues are folded and committed in one pass, so the UI moves between consistent states only. Contrast the pre-18 async gap: with each `setStatus` rendering immediately inside the continuation, intermediate frames could expose half-updated combinations ('done' status while the count hadn't advanced), and code observing the DOM between them saw torn state. React 18's automatic batching closed the gap by making the batch boundary *the microtask*, not *the synthetic event*: everything enqueued in one synchronous run of JavaScript folds into one commit, wherever that run started (event, timeout, promise chain, native listener). The purity contract underwrites all of it — deferring and coalescing setter processing is only legal because enqueueing has no observable effect until commit (Unit 1's idempotence again). And the same reasoning explains the one legitimate exception: `flushSync` exists precisely for the boundary where React meets *non-React* observers of the DOM (printing, imperative measurement, third-party widgets) that cannot wait for the batch — you pay a synchronous commit to give an external system a consistent read point."

              "body": "Every piece of machinery so far — scheduling a render, folding a queue, bailing out on no-ops — hangs on one primitive judgment: *did the state change?* React's answer is deliberately, radically cheap: **`Object.is(next, previous)`** — reference identity for objects, value identity for primitives. Not a deep comparison (cost proportional to the object graph, unbounded), not a dirty flag (requires observable mutation, i.e. proxies/instrumentation), not your equals method (doesn't exist in JS). One pointer comparison. This choice is the whole reason immutability is a *requirement* in React rather than a preference: if you mutate the object held in state and hand back the same reference, `Object.is` answers 'unchanged', React bails out, and the screen keeps showing the old world even though the data underneath moved. The bug is silent and maddening — the devtools show the mutated values (you're inspecting the same object!) while the UI disagrees. Once you accept the one-pointer-comparison premise, everything in this lesson is forced: updates must *replace* objects rather than edit them; replacement must be cheap, which structural sharing makes true; and the discipline pays for itself again downstream, because the same cheap comparison powers memoization (Unit 7) and concurrent snapshots (Unit 8)."

The **immutability contract** for state follows: a value placed in state (or passed as props) must never be mutated thereafter; any update constructs a *new* value that shares unchanged substructure with the old. Equivalent operational phrasing: treat every object in state as frozen the moment a setter accepts it; 'change a field' always means 'build a replacement whose changed path is new and whose unchanged branches are the old references'."

No render. The screen shows one tag; the store holds two; the next unrelated re-render (a parent update) suddenly 'reveals' the second tag — a bug that time-travels. **Attempt 2 — mutate then copy:** `user.tags.push('beta'); setUser({ ...user });` — now a render happens (new outer reference), and the screen updates… and this is the *worse* trap, because it works just well enough to ship. The state that PREVIOUS renders captured in their closures, and the previous props that memoized children compare against, were mutated in place: a memoized `<TagList tags={user.tags}/>` sees old-tags === new-tags (same array!) and refuses to re-render — screen tears, part new, part old. Mutation's damage isn't confined to the current update; it retroactively corrupts every holder of the old reference — queue refolds, memo comparisons, devtools history, concurrent snapshots. **Correct:** `setUser({ ...user, tags: [...user.tags, 'beta'] })` — new array on the changed path, new object above it, everything else shared.

              "statement": "Let state be a tree-shaped value (nested objects/arrays) with N nodes, and let an update change one leaf at depth d, where each node on the path has at most b children. An immutable update that rebuilds only the path — copying each of the d nodes on it (at O(b) per shallow copy) and sharing every off-path subtree by reference — allocates O(d·b) new cells and leaves the remaining N − d nodes shared. Change detection at any node then costs O(1): a node's reference changed iff the update touched its subtree.",
              "proof": "Construct bottom-up: replace the leaf with the new value (1 allocation). Its parent must reference the new leaf, and references are immutable, so build a shallow copy of the parent: O(b) cell copies, all other children copied *by reference* — their subtrees are untouched and shared wholesale. Repeat for each ancestor up to the root: exactly d shallow copies, O(d·b) total allocation, independent of N. Sharing soundness: an off-path subtree contains no changed node by hypothesis, and since values are never mutated (the contract), sharing it cannot leak future changes into the old version — both versions are permanently correct. Detection: the d path nodes have fresh references (each was rebuilt); every shared node keeps its old reference; hence reference inequality at a node ⇔ the change lies in its subtree — Object.is at any level answers 'did anything under here change?' in O(1), which is precisely the query memoized components and bailouts ask. ∎"

The costs are real but bounded: allocation churn (short-lived objects the GC nursery is built for), the spread-syntax tax on deep paths (Immer, or flatter state — Unit 4 argues flat normalization is better anyway), and one genuine sharp edge — **shared references mean accidental cross-version mutation is catastrophic**, which is why the contract says frozen-on-entry, and why dev-mode Object.freeze on state is a legitimate belt-and-suspenders tactic."

The first discipline: make illegal states unrepresentable (a status of 'loading' or 'success' or 'error', not three booleans with eight combinations), with reducers as the enforcement mechanism — state machines whose transitions are the only way state moves. The second: one source of truth — derive, don't duplicate, because every cached copy of derivable data is a future inconsistency. The third: choose state's owner by its lifetime, lifting it only as far as sharing requires, and use context for scoped injection — dependency provision, not a store.

Watch how a typical data-fetching component grows: it starts with `isLoading`; an error path adds `error`; a retry feature adds `isRetrying`; a success toast adds `isSuccess`. Four booleans, each added innocently, each individually reasonable. Now count what you have built: 2⁴ = 16 representable configurations, of which perhaps five mean anything — idle, loading, retrying, success, failure. The other eleven — `isLoading && isSuccess`, `isRetrying && !error`, all-four-true — are **impossible states**: configurations your UI can render (a spinner *and* a success toast), your logic must defend against (`if (isLoading && !error && !isSuccess)`), and your teammates will eventually reach through some interleaving of setters you never imagined. The deep point: those states were not created by buggy code; they were created by the *shape of the model*. Every representable-but-meaningless configuration is a bug that has not happened yet, and no amount of careful setter discipline removes it — only reshaping the state can. This lesson develops the two tools for that reshaping: sum-type thinking (make illegal states unrepresentable) and reducers (make transitions explicit and centralized)."

(1) Modeling with n independent boolean flags represents 2ⁿ configurations; if |L| < 2ⁿ, then 2ⁿ − |L| impossible configurations are representable, and every consumer of the state must either handle or provably exclude each — an obligation that grows with the representation, not the requirements. (2) Modeling with a single discriminated value status ∈ L (a sum type: one tag from a finite set, plus per-tag payload) represents exactly |L| configurations: impossible states are not defended against but *unconstructible*. (3) The minimum n for flags to distinguish |L| situations is ⌈log₂|L|⌉, at which point flag combinations are a dense encoding with no slack — but real flag models are never dense, because each feature adds a flag (n grows linearly with features while |L| grows slowly), so the impossible region 2ⁿ − |L| grows exponentially in practice.",
              "proof": "(1) n independent booleans span the full product space {T,F}ⁿ of size 2ⁿ by construction — nothing in the representation ties one flag's value to another's. Any configuration outside L is still a value of the type; code receiving the state cannot rely on its absence without external proof, so each consumer carries the exclusion obligation. Reachability in practice: each flag is written by separate setter calls at separate sites; an interleaving that sets one and fails to clear another (an early return between two setter calls, a race between two handlers, a forgotten cleanup on retry) lands in the illegal region — the representation offers no resistance. (2) A discriminated union's value is exactly one tag with its payload; a configuration mixing two situations (loading AND success) has no encoding, so no interleaving, race, or forgotten write can produce it — the proof obligation moved from every consumer to the single type definition. (3) Distinguishing |L| situations requires at least ⌈log₂|L|⌉ bits — information-theoretic minimum. The growth claim is empirical but structural: features add flags additively (n ← n+1 doubles the space) while typically adding O(1) new legal situations; hence the slack 2ⁿ − |L| compounds per feature. ∎"

Each site re-derives the legality of its transition from local knowledge, and sites drift apart as the app grows. The fix is the oldest idea in this course's lineage: a **finite state machine**. Declare the states; declare the *events* (not the mutations — the things that happen: `FETCH_STARTED`, `FETCH_FAILED`, `RETRY_CLICKED`); and centralize a single transition function that, given the current state and an event, returns the next state. React ships this as `useReducer`: `const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initial)` where `reducer(state, action) → nextState`. Components stop deciding *what happens* and merely *report what occurred* — `dispatch({ type: 'RETRY_CLICKED' })` — while the reducer, in one auditable place, decides what that event means in the current state, including *ignoring it* when illegal (a retry click during `loading` returns the state unchanged). That last capability — centralized refusal — is what setter-scatter can never give you: with setters, every site can force any write; with a reducer, illegal transitions are dead code paths in one function you can read, test, and prove things about."

Purity of δ is therefore load-bearing for the same reasons: refolds under StrictMode/interruption must be deterministic and unobservable.

All three share one anatomy: a fact F is representable from two places in the state, and *nothing in the system ties them together*. React will not synchronize them — it faithfully renders whatever inconsistent pair you store. The design principle is the database community's oldest: **every fact gets exactly one authoritative home; everything else derives from it on demand**. In React the 'on demand' is free — render already re-runs on every change, so a derivation written in the component body is recomputed exactly when needed, with no invalidation logic at all."

(1) If D is *stored* as its own state cell, correctness requires that every update path that changes S also updates D — k update sites imply k synchronization obligations, and the failure of any one produces an observable inconsistency (a reachable snapshot where D ≠ g(S)). The obligations grow with update sites, and no local inspection of a single site can verify global correctness. (2) If D is *computed during render* — a const in the component body — then in every committed frame, D = g(S) holds by construction: render re-executes the derivation from the current snapshot, and the snapshot model (Unit 3) guarantees S is consistent within the frame. There is no invalidation problem because there is no cache. (3) Storing D is justified only when g is expensive enough to matter (then memoize the derivation — useMemo, Unit 7 — which is still not state) or when D must *diverge* from g(S) by requirement (at which point D is not derived — it is an independent fact, and naming it as such changes the design).",
              "proof": "(1) Suppose site i updates S from s to s′ with g(s) ≠ g(s′) but omits the D-write. The next committed snapshot holds (s′, D = g(s)) — inconsistent and rendered as such. Reachability requires only that site i executes, which is under user control. The verification claim: whether site i 'changes S in a way that affects D' depends on g and on all other sites' behavior; local review of site i cannot establish the global invariant — this is precisely the transition-sprawl argument of Lesson 1 applied to synchronization. (2) In the declarative pipeline, render t computes D_t = g(S_t) from the frozen snapshot S_t; the committed frame renders (S_t, D_t) together. Since D is recomputed in every render and never persisted, no frame can exhibit a stale D — the class of inconsistency is not handled but *absent*, the same move as Lesson 1's unrepresentability. (3) is definitional: memoization is a transparent cache with automatic invalidation by inputs (correct by Unit 7's soundness argument); and if requirements permit D ≠ g(S), D was never a derivation. ∎"

The procedure called *lifting state up* is the constructive version: when two siblings need the same fact (an accordion where only one panel opens; a filter input and the list it filters), the fact cannot live in either sibling — move it to their nearest common parent, pass the value down as props, and pass change-requests down as callbacks. Each lift trades locality for authority: the parent grows a concern, the children become *controlled* — stateless with respect to that fact, rendering whatever they are told. That trade has a direction rule worth making explicit: **lift as high as necessary, and no higher**. Every level too high couples an ancestor to a concern it doesn't need (and re-renders it on every change — Unit 7's colocation argument is this rule's performance face); every level too low forces the fact to be duplicated or threaded sideways. The nearest common ancestor of all readers/writers, adjusted upward only for lifetime requirements, is the unique correct answer — and 'adjusted upward for lifetime' is exactly the chat-draft exercise from Unit 2: drafts surviving tab switches must live above the tabs."

The reshape and the lift are the same move: the fact is *one* value, `openIndex: number | null`, and its readers/writers are all panels — so it lives in the parent. `<Accordion>` holds `openIndex`; renders `<Panel isOpen={i === openIndex} onOpen={() => setOpenIndex(i)} />`. Count what improved: the invariant is structural (one cell can't hold two indices — unrepresentable), the panels became stateless and reusable (a Panel renders what it's told; the exclusive-open *policy* belongs to Accordion, and a different parent could implement always-open or multi-open with the same Panel), and the coordination code is zero — no panel knows siblings exist.

The database answer is **normalization**: store entities in flat maps keyed by id, and represent relationships as id references — `{ cards: { c1: {...} }, columns: { k1: { cardIds: ['c1'] } }, columnOrder: ['k1'] }`. Updating a card's title becomes a depth-1 immutable update regardless of where it displays; 'the card' has one home no matter how many views reference c1; moving a card between columns edits two id-arrays without touching any card object; and deletion is a single delete plus reference cleanup — no tree-hunt for copies. The costs: assembly at render (components join ids to entities — cheap map lookups, memoizable if hot) and discipline at ingestion (normalize once at the API boundary, denormalize never). Rule of thumb: **normalize state that is edited; leave read-only display data in response shape.** A settings screen's static option list needs no ceremony; a kanban board absolutely does — the moment two views can show the same editable entity, nesting is a duplication bug waiting for its interleaving."

A context carrying `{ user, theme, notifications }` re-propagates to *every* consumer whenever *any* field's update gives the value a new identity — the toast counter ticking re-renders the theme-only header. Worse, the standard provider mistake — `<Ctx value={{ user, theme }}>` with an inline object — mints a fresh identity on *every provider render*, converting 'propagate on change' into 'propagate always': every consumer re-renders whenever the provider's own parent re-renders, changed data or not. The mitigations follow mechanically from the semantics: **memoize provider values** (stable identity when contents are stable); **split contexts by change-frequency** (fast-changing data must not share a channel with slow — theme and user in one context means theme consumers pay for user churn); **split read from write** (dispatch/setters are stable — write-only consumers should never re-render for data); and **keep high-frequency state out of context entirely** — a keystroke-frequency value in a wide-fanout context is an app-wide re-render per keypress; that job belongs to component state near the input, or to an external store with per-subscriber selection (Unit 8's useSyncExternalStore). Context is a *broadcast* medium; design what you broadcast the way you'd design a schema, by consumer and by change-rate."

The intermediate never sees user; no context needed; and the technique doubles as a performance tool (Unit 7's children-as-props bailout). Context earns its complexity for genuinely ambient, wide-fanout, slow-changing facts — theme, locale, auth, form scope.

(1) `search` changes per keystroke → the provider re-renders → new inline value object → identity change → *every* AppCtx consumer re-renders (granularity: whole-value subscription), including components that only read theme. (2) Memoizing the value (`useMemo(..., [user, theme, search])`) helps nothing here — search *did* change; the propagation is 'legitimate' per the semantics. The disease is schema-level: keystroke-frequency state sharing a broadcast channel with app-wide slow state. The cure sequence: **colocate** — search text's readers are the box and the results list; it is not ambient truth, so move it to their common parent as plain state (Lesson 2's lifting rule: no higher than necessary), passed as props; keep `{ user, theme }` in context, memoized, now changing rarely; if other distant features truly need the *submitted* query (not each keystroke), publish the debounced/submitted value — different fact, different change-rate, honest channel. Result: keystrokes re-render two components; the context propagates on login and theme-toggle only.

Store {threadId, anchorRange} (position reference), derive the anchor text from the doc in render; when the range is invalidated by an edit (deleted span), derive a tombstone state ('original text removed') — the degradation is designed once at the derivation, not scattered. Ladder: anchor ref = part of thread entities (server cache or doc store); anchor TEXT = derivation, no home at all. (3) Presence is one remote fact with two pollers — double network cost and disagreeing UIs (one polls faster). One owner: a PresenceProvider (context; presence is wide-fanout and slow, seconds-scale) or the app's server-cache layer with a shared query key — toolbar and sidebar both subscribe to the single subscription. Ladder: server-cache/external store (truth lives outside; written by network). (4) The draft dies because it lives in a component whose instance is destroyed on thread switch (address change, Unit 2). Per-thread isolation: key={threadId} on the composer (prevents leaks across threads). Persistence across switches: lift drafts to drafts[threadId] owned by the thread-switcher's ancestor, composer initialized from it and writing back — key for isolation, lifting for persistence; both, because the requirements name both.

Hooks are positional storage: a component's hooks live in a list indexed by call order, so the Rules of Hooks are not style guidance but a theorem — call order must be identical on every render, or every hook after a skipped call silently reads another hook's state. You will prove that, then build a working useState from scratch — an implementation whose correctness depends on exactly the invariant the rules protect — and see custom hooks for what they are: functions that share logic while every call site gets its own state cells.

              "body": "Units 1–4 used `useState` freely while deferring an obvious question: *how does React know which state you mean?* A component function calls `useState(0)` — a plain function call, carrying no name, no key, no identifier of any kind. Yet across thousands of renders, the first call always gets the count and the second always gets the flag; they never swap. The component function itself cannot be the storage (its locals die per invocation — Unit 3), so the state lives in the instance (the fiber, Unit 2). The association problem is therefore: given a bare call `useState(init)` executing inside some component invocation, which of the instance's stored cells does it bind to? React's answer is the simplest one that could possibly work: **call order**. The instance stores a sequence of cells; each render resets a cursor; the i-th hook call binds to the i-th cell. No names, no keys, no registration — and one obligation in exchange: *the sequence of hook calls must be identical on every render of the component*. That obligation is exactly the Rules of Hooks ('only call hooks at the top level; don't call hooks inside conditions, loops after early returns'), and this lesson's job is to show the rules are not style guidance but the *unique correctness condition* of positional storage — a theorem with a two-line proof and vivid counterexamples."

              "statement": "For each component instance, React maintains an ordered sequence of **hook cells** ⟨c₁, c₂, …, cₘ⟩ (in the implementation, a linked list on the fiber's memoizedState). Each cell holds one hook's persistent data: a state value and its update queue (useState/useReducer), a memoized value and its deps (useMemo), an effect record (useEffect), a mutable box (useRef). During a render, a **cursor** starts at 1; the k-th hook call of that invocation reads and advances the cursor, binding to cell cₖ — on the mount render it *creates* cₖ (initializing from its arguments), on updates it *reuses* cₖ (and, for useState, ignores the initializer argument entirely). The binding is purely ordinal: nothing about the call — its variable name, source position, or hook type — participates in the association beyond a dev-mode type sanity check."

              "statement": "Under positional storage: (1) **Sufficiency** — if every render of a component performs the same sequence of hook calls (same length, same hook types, same order), then every call binds to the same cell on every render, and each hook's persistent identity is preserved for the instance's lifetime. (2) **Necessity** — if any render omits, adds, or reorders a hook call relative to the mount render, then some call binds to a cell created by a *different* hook call, and from that point every subsequent call in the render is misbound; state is silently read by the wrong hook (or the sequence length mismatches and React must fail). No implementation of anonymous positional storage can avoid this — the call sequence is the only identity information available.",
              "proof": "(1) By induction on call index k: the cursor is a deterministic function of the number of prior hook calls in the current invocation; if that count is equal across renders for every prefix (same sequence), call k lands on cursor value k and binds cₖ — the same cell each render. Cell contents evolve only through their own hook's operations, so identity persists. (2) Suppose render t performs the mount sequence except hook call j is skipped (a conditional went the other way). Calls 1…j−1 bind c₁…cⱼ₋₁ correctly. The call that was (j+1)-th at mount is j-th now: it binds cⱼ — a cell created by a different hook, holding that hook's state (and possibly a different hook type: useState reading an effect record). Every later call is likewise off by one. The corruption is *silent* where types coincide: a useState reads another useState's value — plausible garbage, no exception. React therefore prefers loud failure: it records the mount sequence's hook types in development and throws 'change in the order of Hooks' / 'Rendered fewer hooks than expected' on mismatch — turning a silent misbinding into a crash. The final clause: any scheme with no per-call identity (no names/keys) has exactly the call sequence as input; two different sequences over the same cells cannot be consistently aligned in general (a skipped call is indistinguishable from a shifted one) — misbinding is information-theoretically forced, not an implementation defect. ∎"

Study which failure you got where: same-type misbinding (email←plan) is *silent* — the theorem's scariest branch, plausible values flowing to the wrong variables; cross-type misbinding is *loud* only because React deliberately records types to convert it to a crash. And note what did NOT cause the problem: nothing about isPro's value is illegal — the crime is that the *call sequence depends on it*.

Positional storage makes each *call site* its own namespace for free — call `useToggle()` twice and the two invocations occupy disjoint cursor ranges; isolation is structural. **The diff-with-defaults idea** (keys with auto-generated fallbacks) founders on minification and code motion. **Compiler-assigned identity** (a build step stamping each call site) is workable — but it is just positional storage computed at build time, with a mandatory toolchain; React chose the runtime cursor plus a lint rule instead, keeping hooks a language-level pattern. The real cost of the choice is the rules' *unfamiliarity*: functions that must be called unconditionally are rare in JavaScript. The real payoff is that hook composition is **associative and anonymous**: any hook can call any hooks, nested arbitrarily, and the flattened call sequence — which is all React sees — remains a constant of the component. The rules are the entire price of that composability; the eslint-plugin-react-hooks rule enforces them statically, and you should treat its findings as type errors, not suggestions."

Syntactic means conservative: a condition that is provably constant (if (true)) still errors, and dynamic violations the parser can't see (calling a hook via an alias not named use*) can slip through.

React throws 'Rendered more hooks than during the previous render'. The bug was present from day one; it detonated only when the condition changed — which is the practical danger of sequence violations: they lurk behind the *untaken* branch, pass every test that doesn't cross the branch, and fire in production on the first user who does. This is also why the fix must be structural, not situational: move every hook above every return (`const [user] = useState(null); const [tab, setTab] = useState('home'); if (!user) return <Login/>; …`) — unconditionally paying the (trivial) cost of the tab cell even when logged out — or split components so the guard lives in a parent and the hooks live in a child that only mounts when rendered ({user ? <Home/> : <Login/>} — the child's sequence is constant *for its own instance*, and mounting/unmounting whole instances is always legal; Unit 2).

Consequences: the parent's own subsequent hooks shift and misbind (order corruption), and Header's state has no independent identity — it resets or collides according to the parent's structure, and conditional rendering of Header({...}) varies the parent's sequence length (the theorem's necessity branch fires).

(c) Positionally, each call occupies its own cursor slot: two useForm() calls consume disjoint index ranges automatically, because indices are allocated by execution order, not by author-chosen names — isolation is a structural consequence of counting, with zero API surface.

(2) **Fold law** — the state delivered by render t+1 equals the left-fold of the updates enqueued since render t over the state delivered at render t, with values acting as replace and functions as updaters. (3) **Binding law** — under a stable call sequence, the k-th hook call of every render reads and writes the same cell cₖ.",
              "proof": "(1) The returned state is `cell.state` copied into the caller's local binding at cursor time; the only code paths that write `cell.state` are the fold loop (runs before the copy, within the same call) and nothing else — `setState` only pushes into `cell.queue`. A JavaScript local captured by value cannot be altered by subsequent pushes, so the binding is constant for the render. (2) `setState` appends each update to `cell.queue` in call order; the next render's fold loop iterates that queue in order, applying `u(cell.state)` for functions and assignment for values — literally the left-fold step function of Unit 3's definition, with the previous render's delivered state as the base (it was `cell.state` when the render copied it out, and no other writer intervenes). (3) `cursor` is reset to 0 at the top of `render` and incremented exactly once per hook call, so the k-th call computes index k−1 on every render; with a stable call sequence, index k−1 always addresses the same slot of `cells`, which is created once and never moved. Hence the toy differs from production React only in scope (one instance, no reconciliation, microtask scheduling) — not in the semantics under study. ∎"

That is why hooks isolate per component *and* per instance — each fiber carries its own list (two `<Counter/>`s, two lists — Unit 2's independent-siblings fact is a data-structure fact). **Scheduling**: our microtask is React's scheduler with priority lanes (Unit 8); 'synchronous render at batch end' becomes 'schedule work at the update's lane priority', but the enqueue-then-fold shape is identical — you can read `dispatchSetState` in ReactFiberHooks.js and recognize every move: it enqueues an update object into a circular queue on the hook cell, bails out early if the folded value is Object.is-equal (Unit 3's no-op skip, implemented exactly as described), and schedules the fiber. **Double buffering**: real cells are duplicated across current/work-in-progress fibers so an interrupted render can be discarded without corrupting committed state (Unit 8) — our toy has no interruption, so one array suffices. Nothing in the production source contradicts the toy; it only adds trees, priorities, and error handling.

Also updaters can't be compared at all (their result depends on the accumulator). Correct: enqueue always; at render-time fold, compute next; if Object.is(next, prevCommitted) skip drawing (and in real React, potentially skip re-rendering children). Real React does a hybrid: an EAGER computation when the queue is empty (it can safely fold the single update immediately and skip scheduling if equal) — legal precisely because with an empty queue the base is current; the general case must wait for the fold.

The real-React lesson: update queues live ON the hook cell (fiber.memoizedState list node), pinned by object identity — which is why setters are stable and safe to call from anywhere, any time (old closures, timeouts, other components), and why the ONLY correctness obligation is the render-time cursor walk.

The pre-hooks patterns — higher-order components and render props — both worked by adding components to the tree: wrappers that owned the state and passed it down. They composed poorly ('wrapper hell': five behaviors = five nested layers, each an indirection in devtools and a false positive in the addressing rules of Unit 2), collided on prop names, and hid which wrapper provided which prop. A **custom hook** solves the same problem in the dimension hooks opened: it is *just a function that calls hooks*, named `useSomething`, extracting a stateful behavior — the state, the transitions, the effects — behind an ordinary function API. No new component appears in the tree; the abstraction is invisible to reconciliation. And the composition rule could not be simpler: because React only ever sees the flattened call sequence (Lesson 1), a custom hook calling hooks — or other custom hooks, arbitrarily deep — is indistinguishable from the component having called them inline. Extraction is *identity-preserving refactoring*: cut hook calls, paste into a function, return what the JSX needs. That refactoring-neutrality is the design's masterstroke, and it has one precise semantic consequence this lesson must nail down, because its misreading is the most common custom-hook bug: **custom hooks share logic, never state**."

(2) Calls of useX in *different components* bind cells on different fibers and share nothing whatsoever. (3) Therefore no state, ref, or effect inside a custom hook is ever shared between call sites; the only sharing is the code itself. Sharing *values* across components requires an actual shared home — lifted state, context, or an external store (Unit 4's ladder) — and a custom hook may *wrap access* to such a home (e.g. useContext inside), but the hook mechanism itself contributes no sharing.",
              "proof": "(1) Within one render, the component's hook sequence is the concatenation of calls in execution order (Lesson 1's definition); a useX invocation appends its m calls at the cursor's current position. Two invocations append two disjoint runs of m; by positional binding, their cells never coincide, and cells evolve only via their own hooks' operations — independence follows. (2) Cell storage is per-fiber (Lesson 2's mapping); different components render on different fibers, so their cursors walk different lists — no shared slots exist. (3) is (1)+(2) plus the observation that a custom hook's closure state (locals) dies per call like any function locals; persistence lives only in cells. The wrapping clause: useContext inside useX reads a provider's value (Unit 4's semantics) — the sharing comes from the provider's ownership, and useX merely packages the read; substituting the hook for the provider is the classic error this proposition exists to prevent. ∎"

The page's cart fills; the badge's cart is a different, forever-empty cart. Nothing is wrong with the hook's *code* — the error is ontological: the team believed naming it `useCart` created *a* cart, but a custom hook is a behavior template, not a store; every caller gets a fresh instance. The fix follows Unit 4's ladder, and the hook's *API can survive it*: create a real home — `<CartProvider>` owning the state via useReducer, publishing over split contexts — and reimplement `useCart()` as `{ const items = useContext(CartCtx); const dispatch = useContext(CartDispatchCtx); return { items, add: (p) => dispatch({type:'ADD', p}) }; }`.

This is the deepest payoff: components become declarations of *what* they track, hooks encapsulate *how*. **Testability**: a hook can be tested in isolation (with a tiny host harness) once extraction separates the behavior from any particular UI. The anti-signals matter as much: a hook used once, wrapping a single useState with trivial handlers, is ceremony (inline it); a hook that returns JSX has crossed into being a component wearing the wrong name; a hook whose behavior differs per call site via a growing options bag is two hooks wearing one trench coat — split it. And the naming contract is binding in both directions: everything stateful gets `use` (so the linter can see it), and nothing *non*-stateful gets `use` (a pure formatter named useFormatMoney invites callers to treat it as unconditionally-callable-only, taxing every future refactor for nothing)."

(1) The refactor was *mechanical*: cut each state+effect cluster, paste into a function, parameterize the free variables as arguments — identity-preserving by the flattening rule, verifiable by the unchanged behavior. (2) The interleaving *risk* is gone structurally: useChatConnection's cells cannot be touched by useTypingIndicator's code — isolation by cursor ranges (the proposition), where before, any line could reach any state. (3) Each hook is now independently testable and independently *reusable* — the typing indicator moves to the DM view by import, not copy-paste.

(2) It's what allows deps: [] — the closure never needs to read `on`, so the callback can be permanently stable without going stale; setOn(!on) with [] would freeze `on` at mount (toggle always sets !initial — works once, then sticks), and with [on] deps the 'stable' identity promise is broken every flip.

Since only hook operations on c_k mutate c_k, each hook's persistent identity is preserved. Necessity: let render t skip mount-call j. Calls 1…j−1 bind correctly; the call that was (j+1)-th now arrives with cursor j and binds c_j — created by, and holding the data of, a different hook. Inductively all later calls are shifted. If the types coincide (useState reading useState), the read returns a well-formed but wrong value — no error can arise from the read, hence silence; if types differ, only React's recorded mount-type list (dev mode) or the terminal length check turns the corruption into a thrown error. Optimality of the rules: association must be computed from some identity signal; a keyless design's only signal is arrival order. Given two different sequences over one cell list, any alignment rule must decide whether a discrepancy is a skip, an insertion, or a reorder — these are indistinguishable from the sequence alone (e.g., ⟨A,B⟩ → ⟨B⟩ is 'A skipped' or 'B replaced A and old B removed'), so no such scheme can bind correctly in general.

Architecture: selection is per-ENTITY state with collection-level operations (anySelected, clear-all), so the honest home is one cell holding an id-keyed structure: const [selected, setSelected] = useState(() => new Set()); toggle = id => setSelected(s => { const n = new Set(s); n.has(id) ? n.delete(id) : n.add(id); return n; }); anySelected = selected.size > 0 — the hook count is constant (1), selection follows ids through any filter/sort, and the collection ops are trivial. If per-row behavior were rich and purely local, the alternative is a component per row (<Row key={r.id}/> owning its state) — instances are the legal 'hook per item'.

      "intro": "Rendering is pure; the world is not. This unit is the doorway between them. Effects are not 'things that happen after render' — they are synchronization: each effect reconciles an external system (a subscription, timer, network request, DOM API) with the current render's values, and the setup/cleanup pair is the contract that keeps that reconciliation correct across re-renders — not a lifecycle to memorize. The dependency array follows from Unit 3's snapshots: an effect closes over one render's values, and the stale-closure theorem makes the linter's demands provably necessary rather than bureaucratic. The catalog of effects you should not write — derived state, event logic — and refs as the sanctioned mutable escape hatch complete the unit. The gate makes you diagnose real effect bugs from the model.",

              "body": "Developers coming from class components — or from tutorials written by people who did — read `useEffect` as a lifecycle event system: 'empty deps = componentDidMount, deps = componentDidUpdate for those values, cleanup = componentWillUnmount'. The translation is seductive because it often produces working code, and it is the single most bug-generating misreading in React, because it frames effects around *the component's biography* (when it was born, when it changed) when the design frames them around *a synchronization obligation* (what external state must be kept in agreement with what rendered state). The honest model: after React commits a render, some systems **outside React's world** — a WebSocket, a subscription, a third-party widget, document.title, an analytics service — may need to be brought into agreement with what was just committed. An effect declares that obligation: *'when these rendered values hold, this external system should be set up like this'* — plus, symmetrically, how to undo it. React then runs setups and cleanups **as needed to maintain the agreement**, and how many times it does so is React's business, not a promise. StrictMode's deliberate extra setup/cleanup cycle in development is precisely a test that you wrote an obligation and not a biography — a correct synchronization survives being torn down and re-established at any moment; a 'run once on mount' ritual does not."

Its lifecycle per component instance:\n\n1. **Mount commit**: setup runs with the mounting render's snapshot.\n2. **Update commit**: if the effect's dependencies changed (any Object.is inequality vs the previous run's deps — Lesson 2), React first runs the *previous* setup's cleanup (closing the old synchronization, with the OLD snapshot's values), then runs the new setup (opening the new one, with the NEW snapshot). Unchanged deps ⇒ neither runs.\n3. **Unmount**: the last setup's cleanup runs.\n\nInvariant: setups and cleanups alternate strictly — every setup is eventually paired with exactly one cleanup (before the next setup or at unmount), so at any moment at most one synchronization per effect is live. The effect's frame of reference is *the values it synchronized on*, not time: an effect's life is a sequence of 'synchronize on snapshot A … desynchronize A, synchronize B …' episodes, and the component's mount/update/unmount biography is invisible to a well-written effect."

Commit 2 (roomId unchanged, some unrelated re-render): deps [server,'general'] vs [server,'general'] equal — nothing runs; re-rendering is not resynchronizing. Commit 3 (room 'travel'): deps differ → cleanup of the *general* episode runs first (closing general — note it closes over the OLD snapshot, which is exactly what lets it name the right room), then setup for travel. Unmount: cleanup of travel. The trace — connect(general), close(general), connect(travel), close(travel) — contains no 'mount logic' and no 'update logic'; the same two functions handled every episode boundary. Now the StrictMode test: development remounts run setup, cleanup, setup at mount. Trace: connect, close, connect — net one live connection, indistinguishable to the user. A version that skipped the cleanup ('we only connect on mount, why bother') shows two live connections immediately in dev — the smoke detector firing on a real fire: without cleanup, *every* room switch in production leaks a connection, and messages arrive from ghost rooms. The lesson generalizes: **write the cleanup first**; an effect without one should be a conscious claim that the synchronization is idempotent and self-superseding (document.title is; a subscription never is)."

There are two timing tiers. `useEffect` runs **after paint** (asynchronously, so the user sees the frame first): correct for everything whose observer is not the user's retina this frame — subscriptions, network, logging, timers. `useLayoutEffect` runs **after commit but before the browser paints**, synchronously blocking the frame: it exists for exactly one job — *read layout, then mutate, without an intermediate frame escaping to the screen* (measure a tooltip, position it; the user must never see the unpositioned tooltip). The decision rule is observational: if running the code a frame late would be user-visible as flicker or jump, it is layout-tier; everything else belongs in the passive tier, because layout effects are a tax on every frame they run in — they serialize JavaScript into the paint path, the exact place jank lives.

The hooks port is *not* a transliteration of the three methods — it is an inventory of obligations: (1) 'subscription ↔ sourceId' — one effect, deps [sourceId], setup subscribes, cleanup unsubscribes; the prevProps comparison **disappears into the deps mechanism** (that hand-rolled diff is what deps *are*); (2) 'resize listener ↔ nothing rendered' — separate effect, empty deps, add/remove listener. Notice what the port surfaced: the class version's structure — grouping by *when* (all mount code together, all update code together) — forced each lifecycle method to know about every concern, and the forgotten-listener bug lived exactly in that forced entanglement. The effect version groups by *what* (each obligation with its own lifetime), and the bug's habitat is gone: no site exists where 'resubscribe' could forget the listener, because they never shared a site.

(3) Even never-unmounting, the missing cleanup breaks the alternation invariant that React's model assumes — future React features (offscreen/reusable state, Activity) explicitly unmount and remount effect pairs; code violating the pairing is forward-incompatible by construction.

Run the logic from first principles, with Unit 3's snapshot model in hand. An effect function is a closure created during a render; every state variable, prop, and derived value it mentions resolves to *that render's constants*, forever. If the effect runs at commit 5 and is not re-run until commit 40, then throughout commits 6–39 the live synchronization is operating on **the world of commit 5**. Sometimes that is fine (the value didn't change, or the effect doesn't care); when the value did change and the effect's behavior depends on it, the synchronization is now *wrong* — connected to the old room, filtering by the old query, posting to the old user. The dependency array is how you tell React which values make the synchronization stale: 'this episode is only valid while these specific values hold; when any changes, retire it and start a fresh episode with fresh closures'. That is why the rule is not 'list what you want to react to' but **'list every reactive value the effect reads'** — the array is an honesty declaration about the closure's inputs, and the theorem below says that omitting one is never a scheduling tweak: it is a correctness hole with an exactly predictable shape."

Then for any render r₂ where v's value differs from its value at E's last run render r₁ — and where D's members are unchanged — the live synchronization executes with v's value from r₁. In particular: (1) the staleness is *silent* — no error, no warning at runtime; the effect simply operates on an old world; (2) it is *unbounded* — the gap between v's current value and the value E sees can grow for the instance's remaining lifetime; (3) it is *latent* — code paths that only run inside E's callbacks (timers, subscription handlers) carry the stale value into arbitrarily later moments. Conversely, with v ∈ D, every change to v retires the old episode and creates closures over the new snapshot: the effect can never observe a value of v older than its own current episode.",
              "proof": "By the snapshot proposition (Unit 3), the effect function created at render r₁ closes over r₁'s bindings; v resolves to v(r₁) in that closure permanently. React re-runs an effect iff some member of D changed by Object.is (the lifecycle definition, Lesson 1). With v ∉ D and D's members unchanged at r₂, no re-run is triggered: the setup from r₁ — including any callbacks it registered — remains the live synchronization, and every read of v within it yields v(r₁) while the committed world holds v(r₂) ≠ v(r₁). (1) follows because closure capture is the language working as specified — nothing anomalous exists to detect; (2) because subsequent changes to v likewise trigger nothing; (3) because callbacks registered by the setup are closures over the same environment and outlive the commit that created them. The converse: with v ∈ D, any Object.is change at commit r₂ runs cleanup(r₁) then setup(r₂), whose closure binds v(r₂); between episodes no code from r₁ survives (the alternation invariant), so reads of v within the live episode always see the episode's own snapshot. ∎"

The user types 'rust': commits happen, `query` is 'rust' in every render — and every arriving item is still tested against `''` (everything matches; results are unfiltered). No error anywhere — clause (1). The developer 'fixes' it by adding an if inside the callback reading a different state — same theorem, same hole. The honest fixes, in order of preference: **(a) put query in deps** — [query]; each keystroke retires the old subscription and opens one whose callback closes over the current query. Correct by the converse clause; cost: subscription churn per keystroke — if that cost is real, debounce the *value* (Unit 5's useDebouncedValue) so episodes turn over at human speed, which is a requirements fix, not a semantics dodge. **(b) restructure so the callback doesn't read reactive values**: subscribe once, deps [], callback does `setPending(p => [...p, item])` (updater form reads no snapshot — Unit 3), and filtering happens in render from current state: `pending.filter(i => i.text.includes(query))`. The reactive read moved from the closure (frozen) to render (always current) — often the best design: cheap subscription, always-fresh filtering. **(c) an effect-event/ref for the latest value** — coming below, for when neither restructuring applies.

(2) **Updater form**: setState(v => …) removes the state read entirely (the accumulator arrives as a parameter).

(4) **Split the effect**: two concerns with different reactive sets are two effects (Lesson 1's decomposition — half of 'this dep re-runs too much' is false coupling). (5) **Effect events** for the genuinely mixed case below. What is never on the menu: deleting a dep the closure still reads, or suppressing the rule — both convert a lint error into the theorem's silent, unbounded, latent staleness. The array is not configuration; it is a *description* that must match the code, and every legitimate technique works by *changing the code* until the honest description is the one you wanted."

(2) Memoization is a cache, not a contract (Unit 7): React may discard memoized values (and future compilers/modes make this explicit) — identity stability is best-effort, so treating it as a semantic key is building on sand; primitives' value equality is guaranteed by the language. (3) Maintenance: each layer of stabilization is a site where a refactor can silently widen or narrow the reactive set.

The necessity test comes straight from Lesson 1's model: **an effect is warranted iff you are synchronizing something outside React with rendered state — because the component is on screen.** Two clauses, both load-bearing. *Outside React*: if the code only reads React state and writes React state (setState in, setState out), no external system exists and the effect is a self-loop — the work belongs in render (derivation) or in the handler (event logic). *Because it's on screen*: if the work should happen because **the user did something**, its cause is the event, not the render — it belongs in the handler even if it touches external systems (posting a form is handler work; keeping a chat connected is effect work). Everything this lesson catalogs is one of those two misplacements, and each carries the same twin costs: an **extra render pass** (setState from an effect always schedules a second pass — the first committed frame is already on screen) and a **tearing window** (between the two commits, the screen shows mutually inconsistent state)."

Computing d in render — const d = g(s) — produces (s_new, g(s_new)) in the *first* pass: zero extra work, zero window, by the snapshot model's within-frame consistency (Unit 3 / Unit 4's derivation proposition).",
              "proof": "(1) Effects run after commit (pipeline placement, Lesson 1): the pass triggered by setS commits and may paint before the effect executes; in that committed frame d still holds g(s_old) — both values are live state, so every consumer renders the mismatched pair. (2) setD schedules a new render (it cannot affect the committed one); this pass re-renders the component and its children again — the update's total cost is two full passes wherever one sufficed. (3) The window between the commits is bounded below by effect-scheduling latency and above by nothing in particular: any work interleaved between the passes extends it. The render-computed alternative reads s from the current snapshot; d = g(s) is evaluated within the same invocation, so no committed frame can exist where the pair disagrees (per-render constants, Unit 3). ∎"

A ref is precisely *instance-lifetime storage outside the reactive dataflow*: the escape hatch you use when you need persistence without participation. The two canonical needs: (1) **holding non-rendered machinery** — timer ids, connection objects, an in-flight flag (Unit 3's double-click guard), the previous value of something, latest-value mirrors (Lesson 2); (2) **reaching the DOM** — getting your hands on the actual host node that commit produced, for the small set of jobs that are irreducibly imperative: focus, scroll, measure, text selection, media playback.

Then: (1) **writes** during render make the render observably non-idempotent — StrictMode's double invocation and any discarded concurrent render (Unit 8) apply the mutation a different number of times than a single pass, so instance behavior depends on React's schedule; (2) **reads** during render make the output depend on a value invisible to every change-detection mechanism — the component renders differently for the same props/state/context, yet nothing (no deps, no memo comparison, no parent update) knows to re-render it when the ref changes, so the screen is stale by construction; (3) both violations are silent today and become bugs exactly when the runtime exercises its licensed freedoms (double-render, interruption, memoized skip). Conversely, confining ref access to effects and handlers preserves all Unit 1–3 guarantees: those sites run outside the render computation, where mutation is already the contract's business.",
              "proof": "(1) Render idempotence (Unit 1) requires k render invocations before a commit to be unobservable versus one; a ref write is an observable persistent mutation (the box outlives the call), so k invocations produce k applications — e.g. ref.current++ counts renders including discarded ones, and any logic keyed to it diverges under StrictMode versus production. (2) The rendered output becomes a function of (props, state, context, ref.current), but React's re-render triggers are exclusively state/props/context changes (Units 2–3); a ref mutation triggers nothing, and memoized ancestors legitimately skip re-renders assuming output is determined by compared inputs — the assumption clause (1) of the purity contract exists to protect. Hence frames where ref.current has changed but the screen renders its old consequence are reachable and unfixable-by-React. (3) follows from (1)+(2): the misbehaviors require only schedules React is licensed to use. The converse: effects and handlers run post-commit/post-event where the contract already permits arbitrary mutation; ref access there is ordinary imperative code, sequenced after the pure computation completes. ∎ (The one sanctioned render-time idiom — `if (ref.current === null) ref.current = expensiveInit()` — is idempotent by its guard and populates a value never read by render output; it is lazy initialization, not dataflow.)"

Layout effects see the node before paint — the measure-then-position jobs of Lesson 3's exercise live there. **Ownership**: a DOM ref hands you the real node, and with it the ability to fight React. The legitimacy boundary: use the node for what React deliberately doesn't model — focus, scroll position, text selection, measurement, media play/pause, canvas drawing, integrating an imperative widget — and never for what it does model: mutating attributes, styles, or children that React renders (`node.style.display = 'none'` behind React's back will be silently reverted by the next commit that touches the node, or worse, won't be — divergence either way; the honest version is state). The test: *could a re-render legitimately overwrite what I just did?* If yes, you are writing to React's territory imperatively — move it into the description. If no (focus isn't in any JSX; scroll position isn't rendered), the imperative act is yours. For third-party imperative widgets, the pattern composes both facts: instantiate in an effect against the node, feed prop changes to the widget's API in effects keyed on those props, destroy in cleanup — an island of imperative code fenced by synchronization."

This is encapsulation applied to the escape hatch — the imperative surface becomes a designed API with the same review standards as props. **(3) Ask whether the handle is needed at all**: 'focus on mount' is `autoFocus`; 'focus when errored' can be an effect *inside* SearchField keyed on an `error` prop — the declarative route often dissolves the need.

The ref is written only in an effect (post-commit); during any single render, prevScore.current is constant (it changes between renders, not within), and — the crucial part — every write to it is paired with a render that already happened, so a read during the *next* render sees 'the value as of the last commit', a well-defined function of the render history. This idiom sits exactly on the boundary: it works, it is widespread, and clause (2)'s warning still applies in a precise form — if score is memoization-skipped or the component doesn't re-render after the effect writes, delta is stale. The honest assessments: for display logic, deriving the delta *upstream* (store both score and prevScore in state, updated together in the transition — Unit 4's atomicity) is strictly more principled: the delta becomes reactive data with snapshot semantics. The ref version is the pragmatic shortcut whose failure modes you now know how to enumerate. The meta-lesson is the real content: **you can reason about escape-hatch idioms** — the propositions tell you exactly which guarantee each one trades away, so 'is this ref pattern safe?' stops being folklore and becomes a checklist: who writes it, who reads it, in which phase, and which schedule freedoms would expose the difference."

Non-retirement: the lifecycle runs cleanup+setup iff some d ∈ D changed by Object.is since the last run. Under the hypothesis (v ∉ D, D unchanged at r₂ where v(r₂) ≠ v(r₁)), no re-run occurs: the r₁ setup remains the live synchronization. Clause 1 (silent): closure capture is correct JavaScript — no runtime anomaly exists; the effect simply computes with old data, indistinguishable at runtime from intended behavior. Clause 2 (unbounded): the argument applies at every subsequent render with the same D, so the divergence |v(now) − v(seen)| is limited by nothing in the system. Clause 3 (latent): any callback the setup registered (subscription handler, interval, event listener) is a closure over the same environment and executes arbitrarily later — the stale binding escapes the commit that created it. Converse: with v ∈ D, a change to v makes the deps comparison fail at r₂'s commit; the lifecycle runs cleanup with r₁'s closure (correctly naming the old resources), then setup whose closure binds v(r₂). By strict alternation, exactly one episode is live and all its code shares r₂'s snapshot; hence no read of v within the live episode can be older than the episode itself. ∎",

Symptom: date library re-initializes per keystroke (waste; possible flicker of formatted dates). Fix: read the atom in render, depend on [locale]; the effect becomes quiescent under profile edits and invariant to future user-object churn. (2) The suppressed [] freezes page.id at mount inside the scroll listener (stale-closure theorem, clause 3): after any client-side navigation, scroll analytics are attributed to the landing page — silently, forever (clauses 1–2). Fix: deps [page.id] so navigation retires and re-registers the listener closing over the current page — listener churn per navigation is trivial; alternatively an effect-event wrapping the track call if the listener must persist. Delete the suppression; it was hiding exactly this. (3) renders.current++ during render violates the ref-purity proposition (clause 1): StrictMode double-invocation and any discarded concurrent render advance the 'first render' flag without a corresponding commit, so the animation skip becomes schedule-dependent (skips in dev, plays in prod, or vice versa). Fix: the requirement 'don't animate initial content' is about DATA, not render count — key the animation to the transition that should animate (e.g. animate only items added after mount, tracked via state set in an effect), or set didMountRef in an effect (post-commit write is sanctioned) if the pragmatic flag is kept. (4) The clearing effect commits one frame pairing the new accountId with the old draft (state-echo proposition's window) and must be maintained field-by-field. Fix: <Form key={accountId}/> — Unit 2's identity reset destroys and remounts atomically; the effect and its field list are deleted. (5) setSubmitted(true) + effect is an event smuggled through state: StrictMode/remount replays can double-POST (the effect re-fires on remount with submitted still true), the toast lags a pass, and a frame commits where the UI claims submitted before the request exists. Fix: the cause is the click — async handler does the POST and toast directly; submitted state remains only if the UI renders it (button disabled), set in the same handler.

First, what a re-render actually is — re-running f and diffing, which is usually cheap — and how to measure before optimizing, because most 'performance fixes' address renders that never mattered. Memoization is then treated with a rigor the topic rarely gets: memo, useMemo, and useCallback form a soundness-conditional optimization — correct only while referential equality tracks semantic equality, and silently broken by a single unstable dependency. Finally, the alternative that usually wins: composition — lifting content into children, splitting components — which avoids re-renders structurally, with no invariant to maintain. The gate asks you to justify every memo you keep, or remove it.",

This unit replaces the folklore with a cost model you can compute with, and its first axiom comes straight from Unit 1: **render is wholesale, commit is retail**. A re-render re-executes component functions (JavaScript, cheap-per-node, but multiplied by subtree size), while commit touches the DOM only where descriptions differ (expensive-per-op, but usually few ops). The corollary that reframes everything: *an 'unnecessary' re-render is one that produces an identical description* — its entire cost is the wasted JavaScript of computing what you already had, plus the diffing to discover that. Whether that waste matters is pure arithmetic: (frequency of the trigger) × (cost of the re-rendered subtree). A settings panel re-rendering on submit: irrelevant at any size. A 2,000-row table re-rendering on every keystroke: 60 wasted full-table computations per second of typing — that is where budgets die. The discipline this lesson installs: **locate cost before spending effort** — profile, find the (frequency × size) products that are actually large, and only then reach for the tools of Lessons 2–3."

(3) Therefore the levers, in order of leverage: reduce the visited subtree (move the state down / composition — Lesson 3), cut traversals at boundaries (memo — Lesson 2), make each visited render cheaper (useMemo on expensive computations), and reduce trigger frequency (debounce, transitions — Unit 8).

The user types at 5 keystrokes/second. Apply the model. The state lives in App, so every keystroke re-renders App and — no bailouts anywhere — Chart, Table, and Toolbar: ~48ms of JavaScript per keystroke, 240ms of work per second, on a 16.7ms frame budget: guaranteed dropped frames; typing feels broken. Now compute where the money is: Chart is 83% of the cost and reads *nothing* from the search text. The cheapest fix is not memoization machinery — it is Lesson 3's first move: the search text's readers are the input and Table's filter; move that state into a `<SearchableTable>` component containing both. Now a keystroke re-renders SearchableTable (8.1ms) and *never visits* Chart — under budget with no memo anywhere, by making the visited subtree small. Compare the memo route: React.memo(Chart) also works (props unchanged ⇒ bailout) but leaves a landmine — the day Chart gains a prop built inline in App (`options={{…}}`), the bailout silently dies (Lesson 2's chain rule). The model's verdict is general: **structure beats annotation** — the update that never reaches a subtree needs no defense at that subtree."

This lesson is about the machinery that does it — and the exact conditions under which it is *correct*, because memoization is that rare optimization that changes program behavior when its hypotheses fail. `React.memo(Component)` wraps a component with a gate: on a propagated re-render, compare the new props against the previous props — each field with Object.is, i.e. **shallow reference equality** — and if all are equal, *skip the render entirely*, reusing the last committed output for that subtree. Notice what the skip asserts: 'this component's output is fully determined by these compared inputs, and equal references imply equal outputs'. Both halves are load-bearing. The first is the purity contract (Unit 1) — an impure component (reading globals, Date.now, uncontracted mutable refs) can produce different output from equal props, and memo *freezes its bugs into the UI*. The second is the immutability contract (Unit 3) — Object.is on references certifies deep equality only because values are never mutated; a mutated-in-place prop compares equal while being semantically different, and memo converts that lie into a stale screen (Unit 3's tear, now caused deliberately). Memoization, in other words, is not a performance dial — it is a *theorem application*, and the theorem has hypotheses you are responsible for."

Then React.memo(C)'s bailout is **unobservable**: for any render where every prop compares Object.is-equal to the previous render's, skipping C's render and reusing its previous output yields exactly the committed UI and behavior of running it. Conversely, memo is **unsound** — can commit a UI different from the unmemoized program — if either hypothesis fails: (a) C impure (equal inputs, different intended output), or (b) props mutated in place (unequal semantics, equal references). The theorem extends verbatim to useMemo (skip recomputation when deps are Object.is-equal; requires the computation pure and its inputs immutable) and useCallback (identity-stable function when deps unchanged; requires the closure's reactive reads listed — Unit 6's honesty obligation relocated).",
              "proof": "Soundness: state and context participation is handled by React — a state update in C itself or a context C consumes punctures the bailout by design (Units 4–5 machinery track those on the fiber), so the skip occurs only when props are the sole possible source of difference. Under (immutability) each Object.is-equal prop is a reference to an unmutated value, hence deeply equal to what C rendered from before; under (purity) C's output on deeply-equal inputs is structurally identical to its previous output. Reusing the previous subtree therefore commits the same description the re-render would have produced — and since render is side-effect-free, skipping it also skips nothing observable. Unsoundness (a): let C read a module counter — the unmemoized program shows updated output on the parent's next render; memoized, equal props skip the read: divergent UIs. Unsoundness (b): let the parent mutate prop.list in place — references equal, bailout fires, C renders the old list contents nowhere (skip), while the unmemoized program would have re-read the mutated array: the memoized UI is stale relative to the unmemoized one. ∎"

Hence: React.memo on a component receiving even one inline-constructed prop never bails out; its comparison runs every render as pure overhead. Effective memoization is therefore a whole-chain property: the component memoized, and every prop either primitive, state/reducer-provided (stable by construction), or explicitly stabilized (useMemo/useCallback) — with each stabilizer's own deps honest, recursively.",
              "proof": "The bailout condition is a conjunction over props; one false conjunct falsifies it. An inline literal or closure is a fresh allocation per render invocation (language semantics — evaluation of an expression that constructs a value); Object.is on two distinct allocations is false regardless of contents. The recursion claim: a useCallback-stabilized prop is itself keyed on deps compared by Object.is; an unstable or dishonestly-listed dep re-mints the callback identity (or freezes its closure — Unit 6's trade-off), so stability propagates only through a chain of honest, stable dependencies down to primitives/state atoms. ∎"

The comparison is cheap — a few Object.is per prop — so the *runtime* downside is usually small; the failure mode is subtler: **boundaries that never fire**. Empirically (and per the chain rule), an unmaintained memo boundary trends toward dead: someone adds an inline prop, the bailout stops firing, the comparison keeps running, and the codebase accumulates annotations that assert optimizations which no longer exist — worse than nothing, because readers *believe* them. Hence the placement discipline: memoize **few, fat boundaries at cost cliffs** — the expensive chart, the 500-row list's rows, the editor's preview pane — where the profiler showed real (frequency × size) products, and where you will notice if the bailout dies; do not carpet-bomb leaves with memo 'for safety'. For useMemo, the same economics: wrap computations that are actually expensive (the profiler's wide bars, or allocation-heavy derivations feeding deps/memo chains), not every `.filter()` — a memo whose computation costs less than its bookkeeping is negative-value code. And the strategic footnote that reframes this whole lesson: the **React Compiler** (auto-memoizing build tool, stable since 2025) performs exactly this analysis mechanically — inferring stable identities and inserting bailouts with the chain rule handled by construction. Where it is enabled, hand-memoization becomes legacy plumbing; the *theorem* remains the part you must know, because the compiler's correctness rests on the same purity hypotheses, and code violating them breaks identically under both regimes."

                  "solution": "Soundness condition: version must be a COMPLETE proxy for every input Chart reads — i.e., data (all of it that Chart uses) changes iff version changes, AND Chart reads no other props (the comparator ignores them!) — note the given comparator returns true even if a hypothetical `theme` prop changed: any added prop must be added to the comparator or the boundary suppresses its updates. That is the one-refactor-away failure: `<Chart data={d} highlight={sel}/>` ships, comparator still only checks version, highlight changes are eaten — 'chart ignores selection' with zero errors, and the code REVIEW looks innocent because the comparator sits in another file. Direction asymmetry: returning false when equal merely wastes a render (safe — the default behavior everywhere); returning true when different SUPPRESSES a real update — committed UI diverges from program state, the unsoundness class, presenting as data-dependent display bugs far from the cause. Hence comparators must be conservative (when unsure, false) and total (account for every prop), and the version-number discipline needs an enforcement story (who bumps it? is it derived in the update path or by hand?) — hand-bumped versions are Unit 4's stored-derivation sin feeding a correctness-critical comparison.",

This lesson develops the alternative family — optimizations achieved by *arranging the tree* so expensive subtrees are never visited, which cannot rot because they are not annotations but structure: no comparison to break, no chain to maintain, no hypothesis to violate. All of them are applications of two facts you already own. **Fact 1 (Unit 1)**: if the element reference at a position is identical to last render's, React skips that subtree wholesale — the `===` bailout, requiring no memo, no comparison of props, nothing. **Fact 2 (Lesson 1)**: propagation starts at the component whose state changed — state placed lower reaches less. The compositional patterns are just ways of engineering those two facts into your tree: *push state down* so triggers start small; *pass content as children* so the churning component receives, rather than creates, the expensive elements; *split components at cost boundaries* so wholesale traversal has natural stopping points. Abramov's 'Before You memo()' argument, which this lesson follows, is worth stating as a slogan: **memo makes React check whether it can skip; composition makes skipping structural.** When a structure fix exists, it is almost always the better engineering — and when it doesn't, you'll know exactly why the memo boundary earns its keep."

(1) If P's JSX constructs E's elements (E appears literally in P's render), every state change in P re-creates E's elements (fresh identities) and the traversal visits E: E pays P's frequency. (2) If instead E's elements are created by P's *parent* and passed to P as props (children or any slot prop) — P rendering `{children}` — then P's re-renders receive the *same* children element references as last render (P's render didn't create them; the parent didn't re-render, so they were not re-created); by the reference-identity bailout, React skips E entirely. E pays only the *parent's* frequency, not P's. The restructure — 'lift the content, push the state' — thus changes E's effective trigger from the fast one to the slow one with zero annotations.",
              "proof": "(1) JSX evaluation constructs elements (Unit 1): each execution of P's render allocates fresh element objects for E; fresh identity fails the === check, so reconciliation recurses into E — by the propagation rule the whole subtree renders at each of P's state changes. (2) Under the restructure, the elements for E are allocated during the parent's render and delivered to P via props. A state change in P re-invokes P only (the parent is above the trigger, untouched — propagation flows down, never up); P's new render reads `children` from its (unchanged) props — the same element references the parent created. At E's position, old element === new element; by Unit 1's immutability argument, reference identity certifies an unchanged description, so React reuses the committed subtree without rendering it. E's elements are re-created only when the parent re-renders — hence E inherits the parent's (slow) trigger frequency. ∎ Note the theorem needs NO memo and NO purity hypothesis on E beyond what rendering already assumes: the skip is justified by identity of descriptions, not by comparison of inputs."

Diagnose with the proposition: Shell's element is constructed in App's render, so every App state change re-creates it — fresh identity, full traversal (the context is innocent; this is costume-2 misapplied, or rather never applied). The fix is the children bailout, one level up: `function ThemeProvider({ children }) { const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light'); return <ThemeCtx value={theme}>{children}</ThemeCtx>; } function App() { return <ThemeProvider><Shell/></ThemeProvider>; }` — Shell's element is now created by App, whose render runs once; ThemeProvider's own state changes (theme toggles, or any future state it grows) re-render ThemeProvider *only*: children pass through reference-identical, Shell bails out at ===, and the context change reaches exactly its consumers through the context propagation channel (Unit 4) — which punctures bailouts *only at consumer positions*, not wholesale. Two deep facts surface here. First, this is why every context provider you have ever seen takes `children` — the pattern is not a styling convention but the *load-bearing performance structure* of provider design. Second, notice the division of labor: the === bailout skips the *tree*, while context targets the *consumers* — composition and context propagation are complementary halves of 'update exactly who cares'."

It fails when the state is genuinely wide-read (the query that filters three siblings). **(2) Can the content move up?** If an expensive subtree sits inside a churning component but doesn't *read* the churn, restructure to children/slots (costumes 2–3) — requires touching the API of one component, pays forever, cannot rot. It fails when the expensive subtree *reads* the fast state (the editor that must re-render per keystroke — no structure can skip a true data dependency). **(3) Only then, memo the boundary** — the expensive subtree genuinely reads *some* of the churning component's data but changes rarely: React.memo with a maintained chain (Lesson 2), placed at the measured cliff. **(4) If the dependency itself is the problem** — everything legitimately reads the fast value but most readers could tolerate lag — change the *scheduling*, not the tree: defer/transition the value (Unit 8), or debounce at the source. The procedure's shape mirrors the whole unit: structure first (rot-proof, hypothesis-free), annotation second (powerful, conditional), scheduling third (changes the requirement itself).

PreviewPane's props change every keystroke (text is the prop!) — a memo boundary would never bail; also fail. The honest conclusion: every component that reads per-keystroke text must pay *some* cost per keystroke — the question becomes *which* cost, and step 4 (scheduling) is the real lever: `const deferredText = useDeferredValue(text); <PreviewPane doc={deferredText}/>` (+ React.memo on PreviewPane — required so the pane bails out during renders where the deferred value hasn't advanced) lets the input update at full speed while the preview re-renders at whatever rate the machine sustains, lagging gracefully under load (Unit 8 explains the machinery). Alternatively, debouncing the preview's input at the source (200ms) is the framework-free version with a fixed lag. The example's purpose is calibration: composition and memo are for skipping *false* dependencies; when the dependency is real, only scheduling — changing *when*, not *whether* — remains, and recognizing which case you're in is the skill this unit exists to build."

Case 2: the parent's render allocates E's elements and passes them to P as children. When P's state changes, React re-invokes P alone — propagation begins at the component owning the changed state and flows down; the parent, above the trigger, does not run, so no new E elements exist anywhere. P's render reads children from its props object, which is unchanged (the parent didn't re-render to produce new props), yielding the SAME element references as the previous render. At E's position, oldElement === newElement; since elements are immutable, reference identity entails the description is bit-for-bit unchanged, so skipping the subtree cannot alter committed output — React reuses it without invoking any component within E. The certificate is description identity, not input comparison: nothing about E's purity, props, or internals is consulted, which is why the pattern has no chain rule, no comparator, and no rot surface. E's residual trigger is the parent's own re-render (which re-allocates children) — E inherits the slow frequency, and if the parent also churns, React.memo on E covers that axis separately. ∎",

The memoization was correctly placed (row = cost cliff) and silently voided. NewsFeed: no price dependency — it re-renders only because it lives under Dashboard, whose state churns at 20Hz: a false dependency, structure's home case. OrderPanel: genuine dependency on ONE price, but it receives the churn of the whole Map — over-broad subscription; every tick re-renders it even when its symbol didn't move. (2) Plan, in procedure order. (a) Repair the rows' chain (cheapest, biggest): one stable handler — const onSelect = useCallback(sym => select(sym), []) — passed to all rows (or dispatch from a reducer, stable by construction); rows then bail unless their own data reference changed, and the immutable per-tick Map replacement already gives per-row reference stability for unmoved symbols (structural sharing's dividend): expected 300-row wholesale → only rows whose price moved. (b) Quarantine NewsFeed structurally: move price state down into a <PriceSection> (or make Dashboard a layout receiving NewsFeed as children) so ticks never visit it — preferred over React.memo(NewsFeed), which would work but adds a chain to maintain on a component that shouldn't be in the blast radius at all. (c) Narrow OrderPanel's subscription: pass selectedPrice = prices.get(selected) (a primitive/stable ref) instead of the Map, or subscribe per-symbol via an external-store selector (Unit 8) — it then re-renders only when ITS symbol ticks. (3) Measure after: profiler trace at 20Hz — commits/sec unchanged (ticks are real) but per-commit actualDuration should drop from ~45ms to low single digits (moved rows only); check actual ≪ base on Watchlist (boundaries alive again); confirm NewsFeed absent from tick commits; field-check INP. (4) The anti-fix: do NOT respond with more memoization (memo on NewsFeed/OrderPanel, deeper row memo, custom comparators) as the lead — the existing boundaries were already defeated by identity churn; adding annotations atop a broken chain compounds the maintenance surface while the two structural repairs (stable handler, state placement) fix the causes and cannot rot.

Interruptibility has a price: state read outside React's snapshots can tear — two parts of one frame showing different values — and useSyncExternalStore is the contract that restores consistency for external stores.

              "body": "Through Unit 7 we treated render cost as something to *shrink*; this unit treats it as something to *schedule*. The motivating arithmetic: the browser main thread owns everything — your renders, event handling, painting — and a frame budget of ~16.7ms. A 200ms render (big tree, mid-tier phone) is not just slow, it is a **lock**: for 200ms no click handles, no input echoes, no animation advances, because JavaScript's run-to-completion semantics won't let anything else run until the render returns. Pre-Fiber React (the 'stack reconciler') made this structural: rendering was a recursive function walking the element tree — component calls component calls component — and **a recursion's state lives on the call stack**, which cannot be paused, saved, or resumed; the only exits are completion or abandonment-with-loss. So React's rendering was an all-or-nothing transaction, and long renders froze the world. The fix could not be 'make renders fast' (app size is the app's business) — it had to make renders **interruptible**: do a little work, check the clock, yield to the browser if a frame is due or something urgent arrived, come back and *continue where it left off*. That requires the one thing the call stack refuses: reifying the traversal's state as data you own. That reification is the **fiber** — and everything else in concurrent React (time-slicing, priorities, transitions, discarding stale renders) is machinery built on the simple fact that a paused traversal is now a saveable value."

The **work loop** renders by repeatedly performing one *unit of work* (begin/complete one fiber) and advancing a `workInProgress` pointer along child → sibling → return order; between any two units it may check `shouldYield()` and return control to the browser, resuming later from the saved pointer — the traversal's entire state is the pointer plus the fiber graph, not a call stack. **Double buffering**: React keeps two fiber trees — `current` (the committed UI's source of truth) and `workInProgress` (the render under construction, each fiber an *alternate* of its current twin). Rendering mutates only the workInProgress tree; commit atomically swaps the root pointer, making workInProgress the new current. An interrupted or abandoned render therefore discards a half-built alternate tree while `current` — and the screen — remain untouched and consistent."

              "statement": "(1) A recursive tree traversal cannot be suspended and resumed by the host: its progress state (which nodes are done, where to continue, pending siblings) is encoded in stack frames that JavaScript provides no way to persist. (2) The fiber traversal — an iterative loop over an explicit pointer into a linked structure — can pause after any unit of work with zero loss: the continuation is fully determined by (workInProgress pointer, fiber graph), both ordinary heap data. (3) Pausing mid-render is *safe* (no observer can detect a half-built render) precisely because of Unit 1's phase separation and purity contract: the render phase mutates only workInProgress fibers — private, unreachable data — while the committed tree and DOM stay untouched; hence interruption composes with correctness, not against it.",
              "proof": "(1) In a recursive walk, 'where am I?' is the stack: each frame holds a component mid-execution with its locals and its position in iterating children. JavaScript offers no first-class continuations — a function's frame cannot outlive a return or be re-entered — so the only way to 'pause' is to unwind (losing every frame's progress) or block (freezing the thread: the original problem). (2) The fiber loop's induction: before each iteration, the complete traversal state is the workInProgress pointer (next unit) plus per-fiber completion flags reachable from the graph; the loop body advances the pointer by pure pointer navigation (child if unvisited, else sibling, else return). Exiting the loop preserves this state trivially — it is heap data referenced from the fiber root — and re-entering resumes with the identical next step: pause/resume is just 'stop calling the loop / call it again'. (3) During the render phase, writes target only workInProgress fibers and freshly-allocated elements (purity forbids everything else — Unit 1); `current` is read, never written. The screen reflects `current`; program-visible state (committed hooks, DOM) lives on `current` or the host. Ergo an outside observer — user or code — sees exactly the pre-render world until commit swaps the trees atomically; a discarded workInProgress is unreachable garbage (render idempotence, Unit 1, guarantees a restart recomputes it faithfully). ∎"

Every state update is *stamped* with a lane at dispatch time (by what kind of event context it fired in); every fiber accumulates the lanes of its pending updates; and each render pass is *for* a set of lanes — the scheduler picks the highest-priority pending set, and the work loop renders *only the updates in those lanes*, leaving lower-priority updates queued. The consequences compose into the headline behaviors: **preemption** — while a low-priority (transition) render is mid-flight, an urgent update arrives; the scheduler abandons the workInProgress tree (safe, by the proposition), synchronously renders the urgent lanes, commits, then *restarts* the transition render from scratch against the new current tree (restart, not resume — the abandoned tree was built against a stale base; idempotence makes the redo semantically free, though the CPU work is repaid); **batching by lane** — same-lane updates fold into one render (Unit 3's batching, now per-priority); and **entanglement rules** ensure related lanes commit together so no frame shows a torn combination of a multi-setState transition.

This repeats — the 80ms render is becoming ~16 slices interleaved with paints; the app remains responsive while 'working'. **t≈23ms**: the user *clicks a button* (SyncLane update on some component). The scheduler sees a higher-priority lane pending: the transition's workInProgress tree — 1,100 fibers built — is **abandoned wholesale** (proposition clause 3: nothing observable was ever produced by it). React renders the SyncLane update synchronously (small tree, 3ms), commits — the click's effect is on screen within a frame of the click. **t≈27ms**: the transition *restarts from the root* against the new current tree (which now includes the click's committed change — no stale base), re-slicing as before, and eventually commits the filtered UI. Total: the click cost the transition ~23ms of redone work; the user experienced zero blocking.

Abandonment at slice 9 discards the workInProgress alternates: these fibers were written only by the render phase, are unreachable from `current`, and produced no observable effects (purity — no I/O, no host writes, no committed hook state; the alternate's hook writes live on the alternate). Dropping them is dropping garbage. No rollback exists because nothing rolled forward: the transaction never touched shared state. Component authors owe exactly one thing for this to hold — the purity contract; the machinery (privacy of workInProgress + atomic swap) does the rest. This is the payoff of designing state mutation OUT of the render phase from day one: 'cancel' is free at any point before commit.",

Resuming would graft frames computed from base A onto a continuation computed from base B: the committed result could mix two snapshots — inter-component inconsistency, i.e., tearing manufactured by the scheduler itself (violating the 'one consistent snapshot per commit' guarantee that Lesson 3 defends). Restarting re-renders everything against the single new base — consistency by construction, purchased with redone CPU (bounded by bailouts: unchanged subtrees === -skip or memo-skip on the redo, so the 'redo' is cheaper than the original where nothing changed).

Look at any real interaction and two kinds of update are visibly entangled: the user types a character into a filter box — the *character must appear now* (sub-frame, or typing feels broken), while the *filtered 10,000-row list may lag* (200ms of lag on results is fine; 200ms of lag on the keystroke is not). Pre-concurrent React had one lane: both updates rendered together, so the results' cost held the keystroke hostage — and the folk fixes (debounce, throttling) worked by *delaying the results update entirely*, trading staleness for responsiveness on a fixed timer with no knowledge of actual machine speed. React 18's **transitions** make the distinction first-class: `startTransition(() => setFilter(text))` stamps the wrapped updates with TransitionLanes — telling the scheduler 'this update may be rendered non-urgently: slice it, let urgent work preempt it, and if a newer transition supersedes it, abandon it'. The urgent update (the input's own value) stays in its high lane and commits immediately. The result is *both* behaviors at once: keystrokes at full fidelity, results arriving as fast as the machine allows — adaptively, not on a timer. The API is two hooks and one function; the semantics — what exactly you opted into — are this lesson's subject, because using transitions without knowing their three defining behaviors (interruptible, restartable, non-blocking-but-consistent) produces confusion the moment one fires."

(2) **Restartable/supersedable**: an urgent commit mid-transition abandons and restarts the transition render against the new base; a *newer* transition on the same state supersedes the older one entirely (the stale render is abandoned, its result never shown — automatic 'latest wins'). (3) **Consistent**: a transition's updates commit atomically — no frame shows a partial combination — and until it commits, the screen keeps showing the *previous complete state* (with isPending = true, so you can render 'stale + updating' affordances like dimming). (4) `useDeferredValue(value)` is the same machinery driven from the *receiving* side: it returns the previous value while a background re-render with the new value proceeds at transition priority — for deferring expensive *consumers* when you don't control the update's dispatch site. What transitions do **not** do: speed anything up (same total CPU), debounce (no timer), or run off-thread (slices share the main thread)."

Responsiveness is preserved; *latency to new content is not reduced* — it's the same 300ms of rendering, now interruptible and honest about being in progress. Two refinements complete the pattern. First, split the state: the tab *highlight* should be urgent (`setSelected(tab)` outside the transition — instant feedback), the *content* deferred (`startTransition(() => setActiveContent(tab))`) — the one-interaction-two-priorities decomposition is the idiom's full form. Second, rapid tab-clicking demonstrates supersession: click Posts, then immediately Contact — the Posts transition render, mid-flight, is abandoned (never commits, never flashes); only Contact's completes. Compare a debounce solution: it would delay *every* switch by the timer even when the machine is idle, and still block when it fires. The transition adapts: instant on fast machines, gracefully lagging on slow ones, always preemptible."

The good patterns: **dim or desaturate** the stale region (content still readable — better than a spinner replacing real data); **pin the affordance** (highlight the clicked tab urgently while its content transitions — the split-state idiom — so the user's action is acknowledged at the interaction site); **suppress spinners for fast transitions** (CSS transition-delay or a ~100ms threshold before showing pending UI: most transitions finish before a spinner would even be legible, and a flashing spinner is worse than none). The anti-patterns: replacing content with a skeleton on every pending flicker (the screen 'breathes' distractingly under fast typing); gating *input* on isPending (the entire point is that input never waits); and using isPending as a data-loading indicator for network requests — a transition tracks *rendering* work; a fetch's latency belongs to Suspense/query-state (Unit 9), and conflating them reports 'done' the moment rendering finishes while data is still in flight. One more consequence worth internalizing: because transitions keep showing the previous UI, they *change what 'slow' looks like* — from frozen screens to stale-but-live screens. That is strictly better, but it is not free: you now owe the user clarity about which truth they're looking at."

For React-managed state the guarantee is structural — a render pass reads each hook cell's value once at the pass's base (Unit 5's cursor walk against a fixed tree), interrupted passes restart *entirely* against the new base rather than resuming (Lesson 1's restart-not-resume), and commits are atomic. No schedule can commit a frame where the header rendered count=5 and the footer count=6, because both read the same cell in the same pass. But one category of value escapes the machinery: **external mutable stores** — module-level objects, Redux-style stores, browser APIs (localStorage, location, matchMedia), anything living outside fiber state that render code reads directly. React cannot snapshot what it doesn't own: if the store mutates *between two slices* of a time-sliced render, components rendered before the yield saw the old value and components after it see the new one — and commit, unaware, publishes both in a single frame. That committed inconsistency is **tearing**, and it is concurrency's signature failure mode: impossible under synchronous rendering (no gap for the mutation to land in), latent in any concurrent app reading shared mutables during render, and — because it needs a mid-render write to manifest — brutally timing-dependent to reproduce. This lesson constructs it precisely, then presents the contract that eliminates it."

If S.value is mutated (v → v′) during the yield — by a timer, network callback, or urgent event handler that writes S — then P completes with A's output rendered from v and B's from v′, and commit publishes a frame in which two components display different values of the same datum. No purity violation by A or B is required (each read S honestly at its own execution time); the inconsistency is created entirely by the interleaving of slices with external writes. Under synchronous rendering the construction is impossible: the pass admits no yield, so no external write can land between A's read and B's read (run-to-completion), which is why the bug class arrived WITH concurrency.",
              "proof": "Timeline: P begins for some lane set; performUnitOfWork renders A, whose function executes `S.value` — the read returns v; A's fiber completes with output f(v). shouldYield() triggers; the loop exits; the browser runs a pending timer whose callback executes `S.value = v′` (legal — S is ordinary mutable JavaScript, and the callback is not render-phase code bound by any contract). The continuation resumes P at the saved pointer; B renders, reads S.value = v′, completes with output g(v′). P reaches the root; commit applies f(v) and g(v′) in one atomic mutation set: the screen simultaneously shows both. Neither A nor B could have detected the other's world: each executed correctly in its own instant. The synchronous case: without yields, A's read and B's read are separated only by synchronous reconciler code; the timer callback cannot run until the pass (and its synchronous commit) completes — the write lands before the pass or after the commit, both consistent. ∎ Note what the proof did NOT need: no misuse of React, no impurity beyond reading a non-React value during render — which Unit 1's contract already discouraged (clause 2) and this proposition now shows to be concurrency-unsafe specifically."

React also uses the subscription's lifetime for correctness bookkeeping — resubscribing when subscribe's identity changes, unsubscribing on unmount — which is why you pass the functions rather than wiring an effect: the hook's internal timing (subscribe *before* checking for missed updates, re-check after) closes the lost-update races a hand-rolled effect version has (subscribe-after-render leaves a gap where a change fires unheard). **getSnapshot** makes the read *explicit, synchronous, and comparable*: React can call it at defined points — during render, and again at pre-commit — and Object.is-compare results; the immutable-snapshot requirement (stable reference until real change) is what makes the comparison meaningful (Unit 3's certificate logic, again). The **pre-commit re-check** is the heart: it converts undetectable mid-render movement into a detected event with a defined response (discard, re-render synchronously). And the **sync-priority scheduling** of store updates is the honest trade: React cannot restart-with-consistency against a base *it doesn't own snapshots of*, so it removes the yield gaps instead. The corollary for architecture: uSES is for *genuinely external* facts (browser state, third-party stores, cross-tab data, module singletons); for app state you control, React state + transitions is strictly more capable — don't move state out of React to 'use the fancy hook', because the move *costs* you concurrent scheduling."

Naive integration — `const state = useSyncExternalStore(store.subscribe, store.getState)` in every component — re-renders *every subscriber on every tick*: getState's snapshot reference changes whenever anything in the store does (immutable updates replace the root), so all subscribers see 'changed'. The refinement: **per-component selectors** — subscribe to the store, but snapshot only the slice you read: `useSyncExternalStore(store.subscribe, () => store.getState().cart)`. Now a price tick replaces the root and the prices branch, but `cart`'s branch is structurally shared (Unit 3's proposition doing load-bearing work in a store!) — its reference is unchanged, the snapshot compares equal, and React skips the re-render for cart-only subscribers. Two sharp edges: (1) the selector must return a *stable* reference — `() => state.items.filter(inStock)` allocates per call: infinite loop or wasted renders (the comparison never holds); derived selections need memoized selectors (reselect-style) or the `useSyncExternalStoreWithSelector` helper, which adds an isEqual escape hatch; (2) selector granularity is the store-world's version of Unit 4's context-splitting economics — one subscription per consumed *fact*, not per store. This example is also the honest résumé of the whole library ecosystem: Redux's `useSelector`, Zustand's hooks, Jotai's atoms are all this pattern — subscribe + immutable snapshot + selector + equality — packaged; after this lesson you can read any of their sources and find the four pieces."

The price: sync-rendered updates (no transitions), and the snapshot/selector stability disciplines. **Derived values**: still computed in render (Unit 4) — deriving from a uSES snapshot is fine (it's a per-pass constant like any input). **Server data**: the next unit — where the 'store' is a cache with staleness semantics and the synchronization is network-shaped. The through-line of the whole unit, stated once more: concurrency didn't add rules — it *cashed* the ones you already had. Purity made renders discardable; immutability made snapshots comparable; phase separation made commits atomic; and the one value category outside those contracts (shared mutables) needed one new API whose entire job is re-importing the contracts at the boundary.

The disciplines that follow: (a) return the store's OWN immutable value (the store replaces its state object on write — the reference IS the version: stable between writes, different across them — Unit 3's certificate); or (b) return a primitive (matchMedia().matches, storage string) — value-compared by Object.is, allocation-free.

Honest architectures: (1) move the filter into React state (useState/useReducer at the table's owner) — now startTransition works as designed: sliced, preemptible, supersedable filtering (the capability argument for keeping owned state IN React); or (2) keep the store but defer at consumption: const filter = useStore(s => s.filter); const deferred = useDeferredValue(filter) + memo on the table — the store update still syncs, but it only re-renders the cheap subscriber; the expensive table consumes the deferred value in a background pass.

P resumes at its saved pointer and renders B, whose body reads v′, completing with g(v′). P finishes; commit applies the full mutation set atomically: one frame displays f(v) beside g(v′) — two renderings of one datum, divergent. Neither component misbehaved locally: each read the store correctly at its own instant; the frame's inconsistency is a pure interleaving product (shared mutable × render-read × yield gap × external write). Synchronous case: rendering runs to completion on the main thread — between A's read and B's read only reconciler code executes; the writing callback sits in the task queue until after commit. Hence both components read identically (both v, or both v′ if the write preceded the pass): no reachable schedule commits divergence. uSES: getSnapshot centralizes reads into React-requested snapshots, compared (Object.is) at pre-commit — a store that moved mid-pass is detected and the pass is discarded and re-rendered synchronously (torn frames never commit); additionally store-change re-renders run at sync priority, eliminating yield gaps for those updates.

            "solution": "(1) location.search read in render is a shared mutable outside React: pushState/replaceState (or the poller navigating) can change it between slices — components deriving filters early and late in a sliced pass can commit disagreeing filter views (the construction, with the URL as the store). It also violates input-determinism (Unit 1 clause 2) even synchronously — same props, different output across navigations with no re-render trigger. Fix: one useLocationSearch() hook via uSES — subscribe to popstate (plus a monkey-patched/router-provided notification for pushState), getSnapshot: () => window.location.search (a string: primitive snapshot, Object.is-stable); components derive filters from the returned value — or, if a router library is present, its location state (which does this internally). (2) MetricsCache is textbook proposition setup: render-time queries + a 2Hz writer landing in yield gaps ⇒ dashboards where the summary tile and the detail table disagree about the same metric in one frame — exactly the inconsistency an OPS tool cannot afford. Fix: give the cache an immutable-replace write path (state = {...}, notify) and expose uSES access with per-metric selectors (stable references via structural sharing) — each panel subscribes to its slice; a metric tick re-renders only its consumers, synchronously (accepted trade: 2Hz sync renders of small subtrees is nothing). (3) Mechanism: transitions are restartable — every urgent commit (incident row updates during storms) abandons the in-flight sort render and restarts it against the new base. On fast hardware the sort completes within inter-urgent gaps; on slow laptops the sort's full pass exceeds the gap under storm-frequency urgent traffic, so it restarts perpetually — starvation, the designed behavior's honest cost. Mitigations: (a) shrink the transition's pass below the gap — Unit 7 levers on the incident table (windowing: render the viewport, not 10k rows; memoized rows so restarts mostly bail out — a restart over unchanged subtrees is cheap); (b) reduce preemption frequency — coalesce the urgent feed (batch incident updates to 1Hz application-side, or mark non-interactive feed updates as transitions themselves so they don't preempt at sync priority; reserve urgency for actual user input). Note supersession is fine here — only the latest sort matters — the problem is completion, not correctness. (4) Verdict: reject. Moving owned interactive state (selections, dialogs, form drafts, the sort/filter state itself) into the singleton would strip it of per-pass snapshots, per-lane batching, and transition eligibility — uSES subscribers render synchronously, so the very jank (3) is fighting would become unfixable-by-transitions app-wide (the Zustand-filter lesson generalized). 'Consistency' is achieved the other direction: external facts (metrics, URL) behind uSES contracts; owned state in React; derivations in render.

First, the proof that ad-hoc fetching races: responses can resolve out of order, and the ignore-flag/AbortController protocol is the provably correct discharge of an effect's obligations, not a style preference. Suspense then makes loading declarative — a component that is not ready suspends, and the nearest boundary shows the fallback — moving loading states out of every component's booleans and into the tree's structure. SSR adds the hydration invariant: server and client must render identical first output, which is exactly why Date.now() in render breaks. Server Components complete the arc: two component graphs, one running at the data source and shipping zero bundle bytes. The gate demands the protocols.",

Network data adds the two properties that generate a whole discipline: **latency** (hundreds of milliseconds between ask and answer) and **unordered completion** (two requests issued in order may resolve in either order — routing, caching, server load; HTTP makes no sequencing promise across requests). Combine those with what you know: a fetch driven by displayed params is a Unit-6 synchronization ('the shown data should correspond to the shown query'), so it lives in an effect with the params as deps. But the effect's *response handler* is a closure that runs when the network decides, not when React does — a Unit-3 escaped closure carrying its birth render's params — and multiple episodes' handlers can be simultaneously in flight. The question 'which response is allowed to win?' is therefore not academic: without an explicit protocol, the winner is *whichever resolves last*, which correlates with nothing meaningful. This is the **fetch race**, the most common data bug in React applications — reproducible by any user who types faster than the API responds, invisible in fast-network development, and completely preventable with a three-line protocol this lesson derives. The lesson then zooms out: the protocol, plus caching, plus deduplication, plus staleness policy is exactly the feature list of query libraries — understanding the race is understanding why that layer exists."

(2) The protocol — each effect episode sets a flag its cleanup revokes: let active = true; fetch(q).then(r => { if (active) setData(r); }); return () => { active = false; } — restores the invariant 'only the current episode's response may write', because changing q runs the old episode's cleanup (revoking its write permission) before starting the new episode (effect lifecycle, Unit 6).

Resolution order B-then-A (permitted by the network): setData(r_B) commits data(B) — correct so far — then A's handler runs setData(r_A), committing data(A). Final frame: query box shows B, results show A. No further event corrects it: both promises are settled; the system is at rest in the wrong state. The failure needed only two overlapping episodes and adverse resolution order — no exotic timing. (2) With the protocol: episode A's closure holds active_A; when q changes, cleanup sets active_A = false BEFORE episode B begins (cleanup-before-setup ordering, Unit 6's lifecycle). B resolves: active_B is true, setData(r_B) commits. A resolves later: its handler reads active_A === false and writes nothing. Inductively, at any moment exactly one episode (the latest) holds a true flag — its cleanup hasn't run — so only the current episode can write state: last-episode-wins replaces last-response-wins. (3) abort() causes the fetch promise to reject (AbortError) — the handler must treat that rejection as silence, not error state; correctness is the same revocation, plus resource reclamation. ∎"

Verify without reproducing: the code shows `fetch(url).then(r => r.json()).then(setResults)` with deps [query] and no cleanup — the vulnerable form. Confirm the timing plausibility: the API's p95 is 900ms under load; a user typing 'rust' produces episodes for r/ru/rus/rust at ~150ms intervals — four in-flight requests whose completion order under load is effectively random; any earlier episode resolving last reproduces the report.

What the effect-cleanup version handles automatically that the counter must remember: UNMOUNT — cleanup revokes on unmount, preventing the write-after-unmount (harmless warning-wise in modern React, but a real leak of work and a wrong cache write in custom stores); the module counter never revokes on unmount (the component gone, the handler still passes the id check if no newer request happened — writing into whatever store outlives it).

Fix: first line of catch — if (err.name === 'AbortError') return; (revoked episode = silence). Production telemetry: aborts are client-initiated cancellations — the server may log them as closed connections (often excluded from error rates), and the client-side error tracking sees an AbortError only if someone reports it as an exception, which the catch swallowed into UI state instead; requests that complete aren't failures, requests that abort aren't server errors — so dashboards show a healthy API while users see flashing errors.

(c) Borderline, lean library-with-short-TTL or hand-rolled with the full protocol: high request volume (dedup + cancellation matter), cache hits on repeated prefixes are real wins, but staleness tolerance is near-zero (suggestions for 'ru' are useless once the box shows 'rust') — the race protocol is the non-negotiable part whichever layer owns it. (d) Cache layer, decisively: 'update after a mutation elsewhere' IS cache invalidation — with fetch-effects, the order list has no way to learn about the cancellation except prop-drilled refetch callbacks or remounting; a keyed cache makes it invalidateQueries(['orders']) at the mutation site.

The declaration propagates up the tree to the nearest `<Suspense fallback={…}>` **boundary**, which renders the fallback in place of its entire children subtree until every suspension within resolves, then swaps the real content in. The inversion is the point: loading UI stops being each component's imperative bookkeeping and becomes *tree structure* — you design loading states by *placing boundaries*, exactly as you design error handling by placing error boundaries (Unit 10) or scopes by placing providers (Unit 4). Components become unconditionally simple (they render as if data is always there); the *where-do-spinners-go* question becomes an explicit, reviewable, product-level decision encoded in JSX; and the runtime gains the ability to coordinate reveals — which Lesson 3 will exploit across the network."

The render of that subtree is abandoned (safe: render is discardable — Unit 1/8). (2) **Boundary resolution**: the nearest ancestor `<Suspense>` catches the suspension: it commits its `fallback` in place of its *entire* children subtree — not just the suspended component. Siblings inside the boundary are hidden with it (their already-completed work may be preserved but is not shown). (3) **Retry and reveal**: when the promise resolves, React re-renders the boundary's content from the suspension point; if nothing else suspends, the fallback is atomically replaced by the full subtree — content inside one boundary reveals *together*. (4) **Nesting**: boundaries compose — an inner boundary catches its own subtree's suspensions, so outer content can reveal while inner regions still show inner fallbacks: reveal granularity = boundary placement. (5) **Transition interaction**: updates wrapped in startTransition that would cause an *already-revealed* boundary to re-suspend do NOT retreat to the fallback — React keeps showing the previous content (with isPending) until the new content is ready; only *initial* mounts (or non-transition updates) show fallbacks. (6) What Suspense is NOT: a data-fetching mechanism (it renders unreadiness someone else creates), and — in raw form — not a cache (`use` needs a stable promise across renders: from a cache, a framework loader, or a Server Component — creating the promise inline in render re-suspends forever)."

The render of Posts *cannot complete* — there is no value to destructure — so React abandons that unit of work (legal: render-phase work is private and discardable) and records the pending thenable against the nearest boundary. Reconciliation continues elsewhere (siblings outside the suspended subtree still render — the pass isn't dead, just that subtree). At commit, the boundary's subtree is represented by its fallback; the real children's fibers are retained in memory (their state is *not* destroyed — a suspended subtree is hidden, not unmounted; an input inside keeps its draft). React attaches a resolution callback to the thenable; on resolve, it schedules a re-render of the suspended region — Posts renders again *from scratch* (its function re-runs; this is why `use` must read from a stable source: a fresh `fetch()` in the body would mint a new pending promise and suspend forever — the retry must find the *same*, now-resolved promise). If the re-render completes, commit swaps fallback → content atomically. Now the details that matter in production: **reveal atomicity** is per-boundary (clause 3) — partial content inside one boundary never shows; **state preservation** across suspension means a form inside a boundary that briefly re-suspends (without a transition) hides and returns with its draft intact — surprising both ways if unplanned; and **throttling** — React may briefly delay revealing nested boundaries (~300ms coalescing) to avoid staccato pop-in, an intentional smoothing you should know exists before you chase 'missing' milliseconds."

The cache version returns the SAME promise object across renders for the same key: the first render suspends on it; the retry render calls cache.get(url) and receives the identical, now-resolved promise; use() unwraps it synchronously — render completes. General requirement: the thenable passed to use() must be REFERENTIALLY STABLE across the suspend-retry cycle for the same logical request — supplied by a cache keyed on inputs, a route loader (stable per navigation), a Server Component (resolved server-side), or a memoized promise.

              "body": "A client-rendered app ships HTML that says, in effect, `<div id=\"root\"></div>` — the user downloads it, then the JS bundle, then executes it, then fetches data, and only *then* sees content: three network round trips and a JS parse stand between navigation and first paint, and crawlers/link-unfurlers that don't execute JS see nothing at all. **Server-side rendering** runs your components on the server at request time — the same pure functions, fed with data the server already has — and streams real HTML: content is visible after *one* round trip, before any JavaScript arrives. The purity contract is what makes this mechanically trivial (Unit 1 clause: same inputs, same tree, on any machine — a component that honors it doesn't know it's on a server), and the server environment is what makes it *restrictive*: no window, no DOM, no effects run (there is no 'after commit' — the output is a string), no layout, one render pass per request. But HTML alone is a painting: the buttons don't work. The second act is **hydration** — the client downloads the bundle, and instead of rendering from scratch (discarding the server's HTML and rebuilding: wasteful and visibly flashing), React *adopts* the existing DOM: it renders the app in memory, walks the server-produced markup expecting it to match, attaches event listeners to the existing nodes, and builds its fiber bookkeeping around them. The page transitions from painting to application without rebuilding the set. Everything interesting in this lesson is in the word *expecting*: adoption is only sound if the client's initial render describes exactly the tree the server produced — an invariant with precise content and expensive failure modes."

              "statement": "Hydration is correct iff the client's *initial* render (same components, the props/state used for SSR) produces an element tree matching the server-rendered markup — same structure, same tags, same text. (1) **Why it must hold**: hydration attaches behavior by *position* — it walks the client element tree and the server DOM in lockstep, binding each element to the existing node it expects; adoption never re-creates matching nodes, which is the entire performance point. (2) **On mismatch**: React cannot know which side is right or how far the divergence extends; it warns and (React 18+) discards the server DOM in the affected region — falling back to client re-render: the user may see content *flash and change* (the server's version replaced by the client's), layout shift, and lost browser state in the rebuilt region; hydration errors in React 18+ can escalate to re-rendering the whole root client-side, forfeiting SSR's benefit precisely on the pages it was deployed to help. (3) **The invariant's practical form**: any render-time read that differs between server and client environments — Date.now(), Math.random(), window.innerWidth, locale-sensitive formatting with different default locales, timezone-dependent dates, feature detection, auth state present only client-side — produces a mismatch by construction (Unit 1's clause 2 violations, now with a second machine to disagree with). The sanctioned pattern for genuinely client-only content: render the SERVER-COMPATIBLE value in the initial render (both sides agree), then update AFTER hydration via an effect (effects don't run on the server, and post-hydration updates are ordinary re-renders — the invariant governs only the initial render).",
              "proof": "(1) Position-wise adoption: the hydration pass pairs the k-th expected element with the k-th DOM node per level (the reconciliation walk of Unit 2, run against real nodes instead of fibers). Binding listeners and fiber stateNode pointers to a node is only meaningful if the node IS what the element describes — matching structure is the precondition for every pointer the pass creates. (2) Given a mismatch at node n, the pass has two irreconcilable descriptions with no provenance to arbitrate (the server's inputs are gone; the client's reads may be the wrong ones); any 'repair' heuristic risks compounding (Unit 2's alignment ambiguity — a missing node is indistinguishable from an inserted one). Discarding and re-rendering the region client-side is the only sound recovery — at the visible cost of replacing content the user is already reading. (3) The listed reads differ across environments by definition (no window on the server; different clock/locale/viewport). A component reading them in render emits different trees on the two machines — mismatch is deterministic, not unlucky. The effect-based pattern is sound because effects are client-only and post-adoption: the initial render satisfies the invariant (both sides render the agreed value), and the subsequent setState is an ordinary update diffed against the adopted tree. ∎"

Read the whole pipeline as one sentence: *Suspense boundaries are the unit of streaming (server), of reveal (Lesson 2), and of hydration (client)* — one placement decision in your JSX now encodes your loading design across the network, the render, and the interactivity timeline. This is also the honest answer to 'is SSR worth the complexity?': with streaming + selective hydration, the old all-or-nothing costs (slowest query blocks all HTML; whole-page hydration blocks all interaction) are gone, and the remaining discipline is exactly the invariant above plus boundary placement you already needed for loading design."

Candidate reads in render: the page formats prices with `Intl.NumberFormat(navigator.language)` — the *server* has no navigator and was falling back to 'en-US', while the client formats with the user's locale: text-content mismatch on every price node (invariant clause 3, locale row). Second find: a `{user && <AccountRibbon/>}` where the server (rendering anonymously cached pages) has no user, but the client reads a token from localStorage during render — structural mismatch for logged-in users only. Both match the incident's fingerprint (locale-dependent, auth-dependent). Fixes, respectively: **make the input agree** — the locale is *request data*, not ambient: read Accept-Language on the server, pass the chosen locale through (serialized props/context) so both sides format with the same value (the general cure: convert environment reads into data that flows through the render); **defer the client-only truth** — render the ribbon's placeholder on both sides and swap post-hydration (mounted-state pattern), or move auth into the server's request context if the architecture allows (cookie, not localStorage — making it request data too). Then verify the fix the honest way: the warning count, the replay flash, and the CLS metric all drop together. The meta-lesson: hydration incidents are *diagnosed by asking which render-time read could disagree between the two machines* — the invariant turns a flaky-looking bug class into a checklist."

Treat the dev-mode mismatch warning with the same severity as the exhaustive-deps warning (Unit 6): it is a proof that your render reads something the two environments disagree on, and every one of those reads is ALSO a purity violation (Unit 1) that concurrent features will find later even without a server.

(c) Mismatch by construction: two machines, two UUIDs → attribute mismatch. Fix: useId() for hydration-stable identifiers, or generate the value server-side and serialize it if it must be a UUID. (d) Structural mismatch for every user: server renders nothing (window undefined), client renders <Map/> in the initial pass → hydration finds an unexpected element. Fix: the mounted-state pattern (both sides render a placeholder initially; effect swaps in <Map/>), or lazy-load the map inside a Suspense boundary designed for client-only content.

Cost: the real content renders one commit late (a placeholder frame — typically imperceptible, but a CLS risk if placeholder and content differ in size: size the placeholder honestly), and the swapped-in subtree mounts fresh client-side (no SSR content for it — crawlers see the placeholder). The typeof-window version branches DURING the initial render: the server takes the false branch, the client takes the TRUE branch in its very first pass — different initial trees, which is the mismatch itself.

Remediation: (1) Introduce/verify Suspense boundaries around major regions with React 18 streaming + selective hydration — hydration becomes per-region, the main-thread work chunks, and clicks on unhydrated boundaries are recorded, prioritized, and replayed instead of eaten (interaction-driven hydration order). (2) Shrink what must hydrate: code-split below-the-fold and interaction-gated regions (React.lazy inside boundaries) so their JS isn't in the critical bundle at all — and (Lesson 4 preview) move static content to Server Components, which ship zero hydration work. (3) Budget the remaining hydration: profile long tasks during startup; break up any single region whose hydration exceeds ~50ms (the INP threshold's enemy), and defer non-critical effect work out of the hydration path.

RSC splits your component tree into two graphs: **Server Components** (the default in RSC-enabled frameworks) execute exclusively on the server — they may read databases and filesystems directly, use server secrets, and `await` data in their bodies; their *output* (rendered element trees, not code) is serialized and sent down. **Client Components** — files opting in with `'use client'` — are ordinary Units-1-through-8 React: shipped, hydrated, stateful, interactive. The architecture's wins are exactly the two standing costs of client React: **bundle** (server component code, and its dependency subtree, contributes zero bytes) and **data access** (fetching happens in the component that needs it, server-side, where the database is milliseconds away — Lesson 1's waterfalls collapse even when sequential).

(3) **Composition rule**: server components may render client components (the serialized output references them by module id, to be hydrated); client components may NOT import server components — but they MAY receive server-rendered content as props/children (the 'slot' pattern): the server renders both graphs' skeleton, interleaving serialized server output into client components' children.

The heuristic: **push 'use client' to the leaves** — make the page's skeleton, content, and data assembly server components, and mark as client only the interactive *islands*: buttons, forms, dropdowns, anything with useState/effects/handlers. Each 'use client' is a *bundle frontier*: everything it imports (that isn't already server-only) ships — so a 'use client' on a page-level component drags the entire page's dependency tree into the bundle, refunding RSC's principal benefit with one line. Concretely wrong: marking `PostPage` client because one Like button needs state (the markdown parser now ships). Concretely right: PostPage stays server; LikeButton is a five-line client island receiving serializable props. The **slot pattern** handles the middle case — a client component that *wraps* rich content (a collapsible section, a carousel, a tabbed container): the interactivity (open/closed state) is client; the content inside is server-rendered and passed as children — the client component manipulates *where and whether* server output shows without owning its code. And the composition consequence worth memorizing: **the tree can alternate** — server → client → (via children) server → client — because children-passing moves rendered *values* through the boundary, not modules; only imports are one-directional. When you find yourself unable to alternate (a deep client component 'needs' fresh server data), the architecture is telling you to lift the data to the nearest server ancestor and thread it down — or that this data is genuinely dynamic and belongs to the client's cache layer (Lesson 1) instead."

Total shipped: page + chart lib + date lib + fetching machinery; content at ~3 round trips. The RSC refactor, decision by decision: **Dashboard → server**: the two fetches become awaits in the body — and the waterfall stays *sequential but collapses* (server-to-service latency ~2ms: 3 round trips × 2ms, not × 300ms — Lesson 1's arithmetic, relocated); the KPI cards render server-side from the data (zero bundle). **Chart**: the chart *library* must execute where the canvas is — client island — but its *data* arrives as a serializable prop from the server parent: `'use client' Chart({series})`; the 90kb ships (unavoidable for a canvas-drawing dependency — RSC does not eliminate interactive code, only non-interactive code). **Feed timestamps**: '3m ago' is client-relative time — rendering it server-side violates Lesson 3's invariant on hydration... except RSC output for server components doesn't hydrate (no client code to disagree!) — but it also never *updates*: a static '3m ago' rots on screen. Honest split: server renders the absolute time; a tiny client `<RelativeTime ts={…}/>` island formats and ticks it. **Filter dropdown → client island** (selection state), but *what it filters* re-renders server-side via the refresh semantics: selecting a filter updates the URL (router state), the server re-renders the feed for the new params, and the client reconciles — selection state in the dropdown island *survives* (clause 5: state preserved where positions match). Net: bundle = chart + two tiny islands; data = collapsed waterfall; interactivity = untouched.

The architecture is also older than it looks: 'templates render on the server, behavior attaches on the client' is how the web worked pre-SPA — RSC's novelty is doing it in ONE component model, with typed composition across the boundary, per-component granularity, and state-preserving refreshes instead of full-page reloads.

The frontier rule: 'use client' marks where the SERVER graph ends — everything reachable by import from there ships; boundaries therefore belong at the SMALLEST subtree that needs a client lifetime. Corrected: ProductPage (no directive) stays server — awaits product data, renders markdown/gallery/prices server-side; AddToCartButton.jsx gets 'use client' and receives {productId, price} as serializable props; if the gallery needs interaction (zoom, carousel), IT becomes its own island receiving image URLs — each island minimal, the page's heavy rendering deps never shipping.

If client code could import it, the bundler would ship server code to every visitor's browser: the exploit is trivial — view-source/bundle-inspect to read credentials and query logic, and potentially execute data-access paths against exposed endpoints. Children-passing is safe because it moves the server component's OUTPUT — an already-rendered, serialized element tree containing only markup and data deliberately included — across the boundary: values, not code; what the server chose to render, not what it knows. The asymmetry is thus an information-flow control: code flows only server→bundle when explicitly marked ('use client' is consent to ship), data flows only through the serializable-prop channel (reviewable, typed), and secrets have no path to the client at all unless a developer serializes them into props — which is why frameworks add taint APIs (experimental_taintObjectReference) to make even THAT mistake loud.

The moved row: it left the 'active' list and appeared in 'done' — a DIFFERENT parent. By Unit 2's addressing rule, matching is per sibling list: the old instance (in active) is unmounted — its expanded state DIES — and a fresh instance mounts in done (collapsed, the default). Whether that's correct is a product question (arguably a completed task collapsing is fine; a form draft dying would not be). Authoring rules that follow: (1) key rows by entity id everywhere so WITHIN-list reorders preserve state (id-keyed matching); (2) know that CROSS-list moves reset islands — if state must survive a move, lift it out of the island into client-owned storage keyed by entity (a client store/map, Unit 4's lifting, with the island reading drafts[taskId]) or reflect it in server data; (3) design island state as 'ephemeral by default, lifted when precious' — the refresh model makes that line explicit and testable: simulate a revalidation and see what survives.",

Then A resolves: its handler — a live closure with no guard — runs setData(r_A), committing results-for-'a' under a box showing 'ab'. Both promises are now settled; no pending event can correct the state: the wrong frame is stable until the user changes q again. The construction required only overlap plus adverse ordering — both routine under real latency. (2) Add per-episode revocation: let active = true; …then(r => { if (active) setData(r) }); return () => { active = false }. The effect lifecycle (Unit 6) guarantees cleanup-before-setup on deps change: when q moves a→ab, A's cleanup sets active_A = false BEFORE B's setup runs. Invariant, by induction over episodes: after any prefix of lifecycle events, exactly the latest episode's flag is true (each new episode's setup is preceded by its predecessor's cleanup; unmount cleans the last). Therefore any resolving handler writes iff its episode is still current: stale responses are dropped at the guard. With AbortController, cleanup additionally cancels the request; the promise rejects with AbortError, which the catch must treat as silence (a revoked episode is not a failure) — same invariant, plus reclaimed resources. (3) Debouncing delays issue until input pauses, reducing how often episodes overlap — but whenever two requests HAVE been issued (pause, type, pause), their completion order remains unconstrained: a 300ms-debounced pair can still resolve inverted (first request slow, second fast). Ordering is a network property independent of issue spacing, so the stale-write path survives debouncing; only revocation (or version-tagging, its cache-layer equivalent) eliminates it. Debounce for request volume and UX; the protocol for correctness. ∎",

Page root, product data assembly, markdown description, price block: SERVER — none has state, effects, or handlers (the deciding question: no client lifetime), and the markdown parser is exactly the dependency RSC exists to keep off the wire. Image gallery: CLIENT island (zoom/carousel state), receiving image URLs — serializable. Add-to-Cart: CLIENT island (pending state, POST action; consider a server action for the mutation), props {productId, price}. Review sorting: product decision surfaced by the boundary — client island re-sorting delivered reviews (fast, page-scoped) OR sort-in-URL driving server re-render (full-dataset, shareable, state-preserving via refresh semantics); either way the LIST content renders server-side, the control is a thin island. Presence ('2 viewing'): CLIENT island by nature — a live WebSocket subscription (server components render once per request; they cannot hold a connection open to the page). Data redesign: product, reviews, recommendations become awaits in the server components that render them — the previous effect-waterfall (3 × ~300ms client round trips, plus race surface) collapses to server-local calls (~ms each), and Lesson 1's protocol becomes unnecessary FOR THOSE READS because there are no competing client episodes — the request IS the episode. Presence keeps the full Unit-6/8 discipline: subscribe in an effect (or uSES), clean up on unmount, and treat its updates as external-store sync. Unchanged machinery (the two places): (i) the presence socket — effect lifecycle, cleanup pairing, and snapshot/latest-read decisions apply verbatim; (ii) Add-to-Cart — an action-caused mutation: handler-shaped (Unit 6's necessity test), with double-click guarding (Unit 3's ref/disabled pattern) and optimistic-vs-confirmed state as a product choice; additionally every island still owes Lesson 3's hydration invariant (no localStorage/window reads in initial renders). Against their plan, quantified: 'use client' at the root makes the ENTIRE page a client entry — the 70kb parser plus gallery/date/format dependencies all ship and hydrate (likely 100s of kb), and server-side data access becomes impossible from those components (they run client-side), so the effect-waterfall AND its race surface survive the migration intact: the plan pays RSC's complexity while refunding both of its benefits.

Every component has a contract — the props it accepts, their types, which combinations are legal — that is *implicit* in plain JavaScript: it lives in the author's head, in the destructuring, in runtime crashes when a caller violates it. TypeScript makes the contract *explicit and checked*: a `Props` type is a specification the compiler verifies at every call site, converting a class of runtime failures (undefined is not a function, cannot read property of null, a boolean where a string was meant) into red squiggles that never ship. But the deep value is not catching typos — it is that **a well-designed prop type makes illegal usage unrepresentable**, exactly Unit 4's principle applied to the component boundary. A `Button` that must be *either* a link (with `href`) *or* an action (with `onClick`) but never both, and never neither, can encode that as a type the compiler enforces — so the invalid call is not documented against, it is *uncompilable*. This lesson develops types as contracts: modeling props so wrong calls don't type-check, typing state and hooks so the reducer's transitions are checked, and treating the type as the component's primary, always-accurate documentation — the one form of docs that cannot drift from the code because the compiler rejects drift."

This is the payoff Unit 4 promised, now mechanically enforced — the state machine's totality is checked, not hoped for. **useRef** needs its intent typed: `useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null)` for a DOM ref (nullable until attached — the type tells you to null-check), versus `useRef(0)` for a mutable box (non-null, you own it). **Context** must be typed to force the provider check — `createContext<Theme | null>(null)` plus a `useTheme()` hook that throws (and narrows away the null) if no provider is present, converting Unit 4's 'default value or missing provider' ambiguity into a typed, guarded read. The through-line: inference handles the easy 80%; the 20% it can't (nullability, emptiness, unions, refs, context) is exactly where the bugs are, so annotate there deliberately."

Three enforcements compound: (1) you cannot construct an illegal state (the State union has no `{status:'success'}` without data — Unit 4's unrepresentability, now a compile error, not a runtime hope); (2) you cannot read a payload that doesn't belong to the current variant (`state.data` is a type error unless you've narrowed to 'success' — the compiler forces the `if (state.status === 'success')` guard that prevents 'cannot read data of undefined'); (3) with `default: return assertNever(action)` where `function assertNever(x: never): never { throw … }`, adding a fourth action later and forgetting to handle it makes `action` not-`never` in the default, a *compile error naming the omission*.

Prefer `unknown` (forces a narrowing check before use) for genuinely dynamic values.

New engineers read the props type to learn a component the way one reads a function signature — and it is always accurate. Second, **types make large refactors mechanical**: rename a prop, change a payload's shape, split a component, and the compiler produces an exhaustive worklist of every affected call site — refactoring becomes 'fix all the red until it's green', a finite bounded task, rather than 'grep, guess, and hope QA catches the misses'. This is the same shift the depth floors and validators in *this very platform* embody (a machine-checked contract beats a prose promise) — and it is why typed React scales to large teams where untyped React accrues 'don't touch that component, nobody knows its contract' debt. The discipline to internalize: **write the type first, as the spec**; if the type is hard to write (a component that takes 'a config that's sometimes a string and sometimes an object with different required fields depending on a mode flag'), that difficulty is the *design* telling you the contract is too loose — tighten the component, and the type gets easy.

              "body": "A test suite is an asset only if it fails when the app breaks and passes when the app works — and the most common way suites fail this is by testing *implementation* instead of *behavior*. An implementation test asserts on internals: 'state.count is 3', 'the useEffect ran', 'this child component received these props', 'the component is in loading state'. It has two fatal properties: it breaks on *refactors that change nothing the user experiences* (rename the state variable, restructure into a reducer, split a component — all green-to-red with zero real regressions, training the team to distrust and ignore the suite), and it *passes through real bugs* (state.count is 3 but the number rendered to the DOM is 2 because of a display bug the test never looked at the DOM to catch). A behavior test asserts what a *user* would observe and do: 'the screen shows 3', 'clicking increment makes it show 4', 'submitting the empty form shows a required-field error'. Its properties are the inverse: it survives any refactor that preserves behavior (the whole point of a refactor), and it catches any bug that changes what the user sees. The guiding principle, from Testing Library's design: **the more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they give you**. This lesson operationalizes that — querying the DOM as a user perceives it, driving interactions as a user would, and the one React-specific wrinkle (`act`) that the async, batched render model forces on honest tests."

Formally, treat the component as a black box computing DOM = f(props, user-events over time); a behavioral test constrains f's observable outputs for given inputs. **Corollaries**: (1) queries should locate elements the way users do — by accessible role, label, and visible text — not by test-ids or DOM structure, so the query breaks only when the user-facing element changes; (2) interactions should simulate real event sequences (a click is pointer-down/up/focus/click; typing fires per-character events) — userEvent, not synthetic shortcuts; (3) assertions should read the resulting DOM, not the component's internals. **The act() requirement**: any state update triggered in a test must be wrapped so React flushes its render+effects before assertions — React warns if updates occur outside act, because asserting on a mid-update tree (before the batched render commits) tests a state the user never sees.

              "body": "`act()` confuses people until they connect it to Units 1 and 3. A state update does not synchronously update the DOM — it schedules a render, which React batches and flushes, after which effects run (Unit 1's pipeline; Unit 3's queue). In a test, if you trigger an update and *immediately* assert, you may be reading the DOM *before* React has committed the new render — a torn moment the user never experiences, because between event and paint React always flushes. `act()` is the test-time boundary that says 'apply all pending work — renders, effects, microtasks — and settle, as would happen before the user sees anything', so your assertions run against a committed, consistent tree. The 'not wrapped in act' warning is therefore not ceremony: it means *your test observed a state React was mid-way through producing* — asserting on it tests a non-frame, and worse, the settling might change the result after your assertion passed (a false green) or fire an effect that logs an error your test misses. The practical rule dissolves most of the pain: **use `userEvent` for interactions and `findBy*`/`waitFor` for async — they wrap `act` for you** — and reach for manual `act()` only when driving updates outside those (a raw store dispatch, a manual timer advance, a directly-called imperative handle). The mental model: `act` makes the test observe the same settled world the user observes; skipping it observes React's private in-progress work — the exact thing Units 1 and 8 spent pages keeping *unobservable*, briefly made observable by a test poking too early."

Fill and submit against a mocked API (mock the *network*, at the fetch/MSW layer — the app's real boundary — not the component's functions): `await user.type(screen.getByLabelText(/email/i), 'a@b.co'); await user.click(...)`. Success path: `await screen.findByText(/check your inbox/i)` — findBy waits for the post-fetch render, wrapping act; the assertion is that the *screen settled to the success state*, exactly what the user waits for. Error path: configure the mock to reject/500, assert the error message appears and — behaviorally important — that the form is still filled (the user's data wasn't lost) and re-submittable. Notice what this test never does: check `status === 'submitting'`, verify `fetch` was called with specific args as its *primary* assertion (a light call-check is fine as a secondary guard, but the primary assertion is the user-visible outcome), or inspect child component props. It reads as the feature's acceptance criteria in code — which is why it survives every refactor that preserves those criteria (reducer, state shape, component split) and fails on every regression that violates them (broken validation, swallowed error, lost input).

This lesson handles the other case, and it has a sharp, non-obvious rule: **an uncaught error thrown during a component's render, in a lifecycle method, or in a constructor unmounts the entire React tree by default** — the whole app goes blank, not just the broken component. The reasoning is principled, not a bug: React cannot know how far the corruption from a failed render extends, and rendering a *partially* broken tree risks showing wrong or dangerous UI (a payment form missing its total, a permissions check that silently failed open); a blank screen is a safer failure than a subtly-wrong one. But a blank app is a terrible *user* experience for a localized failure — one broken widget shouldn't nuke the page. **Error boundaries** are the mechanism to contain the blast: a component that 'catches' errors thrown by its descendants during render and commits a fallback UI in their place, exactly as a `try/catch` contains a throw — except scoped to the render phase and expressed as tree structure (like Suspense boundaries, Lesson 9.2: place a boundary, define what shows when the subtree fails). The design symmetry is worth seeing: Suspense boundaries catch 'not ready yet' (a suspension), error boundaries catch 'failed' (a throw), and both replace their subtree with a fallback declared in JSX — React's two ways of saying 'this region couldn't render its real content, here's what to show instead'.

It **does not catch**: (1) errors in **event handlers** (they run outside render — use ordinary try/catch; a click that throws doesn't corrupt the tree); (2) errors in **asynchronous code** (setTimeout, promise callbacks, fetch .then — they escape the render call stack; handle at the async site, surface via state); (3) errors during **server-side rendering**; (4) errors thrown by the **boundary itself** (a boundary can't catch its own render error — it propagates to the next boundary up).

              "body": "The 'doesn't catch event handlers or async' rule frustrates people until they see it follows necessarily from Unit 1's model. An error boundary catches *render-phase* failures because the render phase is where React is *in control of the call stack* — it invokes your components, so it can wrap those invocations and catch what they throw, and a render failure genuinely threatens tree integrity (a half-rendered tree is React's problem to contain). Event handlers and async callbacks run *outside* render — React isn't on the stack when your onClick fires or your promise resolves (Unit 3's escaped closures, Unit 6's effect callbacks); an error there doesn't corrupt the render tree, and React has no call-stack position from which to catch it. So the scope isn't a limitation React failed to fix — it's the precise boundary of where render-tree corruption can occur, which is exactly what error boundaries exist to contain. This clarifies the division of labor: **render errors → error boundaries** (the tree might be corrupt; contain and show a fallback); **handler/async errors → try/catch + error state** (the tree is fine; this is a *failed operation*, model it as a failure state in your Unit-4 machine and render it, because the user needs a specific, recoverable message — 'payment declined', 'save failed, retry' — not a whole-subtree fallback). The mature app uses both deliberately: boundaries as the safety net for the *unexpected* (bugs, null derefs, the crashes you didn't foresee), and modeled error states for the *expected* failures (network errors, validation, declined operations — the failures your product has real UX for). Conflating them — routing expected failures through boundaries, or trying to boundary-catch a handler throw — is the common mistake this scope rule prevents."

Trace the coverage: unexpected render bugs → contained by boundaries (app + per-widget); async loading → Suspense; expected operation failures → modeled states with tailored UX. Every failure mode has a designed response, and the *placement* of boundaries in the JSX is the design document for 'what stays usable when this part breaks' — reviewable, like the Suspense reveal story of Lesson 9.2."

A blank screen is a safe failure; a subtly-wrong one is not — so absent a boundary, React chooses safety and unmounts everything. This justifies placement by BLAST RADIUS and SENSITIVITY: wrap the whole app in a last-resort boundary (never fully blank); give the nav its own region so content crashes don't kill navigation (the user can still leave); wrap main content in its own boundary (its bugs don't touch nav or payment); and wrap the payment sidebar in its OWN boundary with an especially careful fallback — precisely because payment is sensitive, you never want a content-area bug to render a broken payment UI, and you never want a payment bug to blank the whole app mid-transaction.

Three failures under it: (1) a deep chart component null-derefs during render → the whole app (nav, content, everything) is replaced by the app-crash screen for a one-widget bug — massive over-containment. (2) A save button's fetch rejects → NOT caught at all (async in a handler); if the code didn't try/catch it, the promise rejection is unhandled and the user sees nothing happen — a silent failure the boundary was falsely assumed to cover. (3) A form validation throw in an onChange → also uncaught (handler); silent or console-only. So the single boundary both over-reacts to render bugs and misses the majority of real errors. Better structure: (a) granular boundaries per independent region (widgets, routes) so render bugs fail locally, plus the top boundary as last resort; (b) model EXPECTED failures (network, validation, declined ops) as Unit-4 error STATES caught in handlers/effects and rendered inline with tailored recovery UX — not routed through boundaries at all; (c) retry/reset paths on every fallback.

What DataWidget MUST contain: the refresh handler's try/catch + error state (its own operation's expected failure). What it must NOT contain: a loading branch (Suspense owns that — it reads data via use()/a suspense query assuming success) or a render-time try/catch for unexpected crashes (the boundary owns that) — the component is written for the happy path, with the two boundaries absorbing not-ready and crashed. Transient recovery: the boundary's retry re-attempts the subtree render; resetKeys={[widgetId]} auto-recovers when the user switches widgets (a failure for id 7 doesn't persist onto id 8); the refresh error state clears on a successful retry.

Asserting status === 'submitting' checks an internal state variable that can be perfectly correct while the button is wired to the wrong handler and the success UI never renders — the state and the user's experience are decoupled, and the test only looked at the state. Mocking useCheckout (the form's own hook) and OrderSummary (its child) removes exactly the integration where the bug lives: whether the REAL onClick calls the REAL handler that drives the REAL rendered outcome. Checking that `validate` was called asserts a function invocation, not that the user sees a validated, submittable, succeeding form. So every assertion passed while the feature was broken, because none of them clicked the actual button through to an actual visible result — the suite is fast and green precisely because it isn't testing the thing that broke. Rewrite: render <CheckoutForm/> with its real hook and real OrderSummary; mock only the boundaries — the payment/order network via MSW and the payment SDK. Then drive the user story: fill the fields with userEvent, click the real 'Pay' button (getByRole('button', { name: /pay/i })), and assert the user-visible outcomes — validation errors appear for bad input, and on success await screen.findByText(/order confirmed/i). How it catches THIS bug: the mis-wired onClick means clicking 'Pay' produces no submission, so the success message never appears — findByText times out — RED; and if the success message simply never renders despite a correct submit, the same assertion fails. The behavioral test asserts the exact thing the user couldn't do (complete checkout and see confirmation), so it goes red precisely when checkout breaks, which is the entire point of the suite. The old suite optimized for speed and isolation and bought zero confidence; the rewrite is slightly slower and catches the release-blocking bug.",

              "Types: discriminated-union row state (idle/editing/saving/error with per-variant payload) and action union with an exhaustive reducer (assertNever); precise row-data types with runtime validation at the fetch boundary (schema.parse) rather than `as`, since rows are external data",

            ],
            "solution": "Types: model per-row edit state as a discriminated union — type RowState = { status: 'view' } | { status: 'editing'; draft: Row } | { status: 'saving'; draft: Row } | { status: 'error'; draft: Row; error: string } — and actions as a union (EDIT/CHANGE/SAVE/RESOLVE/REJECT/CANCEL); the reducer switches on status with assertNever(action) in default so a new action is a compile error (Unit 4's totality, enforced by Unit 10.1). Row DATA is external, so validate at the fetch boundary — RowsSchema.parse(await res.json()) — giving a checked type instead of an `as` assertion that would let malformed rows through to crash rendering. Failure architecture, split by expected vs unexpected: EXPECTED failures are modeled states — a save that rejects transitions the row's reducer to { status: 'error', error } rendered inline ('save failed, retry') with the draft preserved (the user's edit isn't lost); bulk-delete failure is a handler-caught error state showing a toast/inline message with retry; loading is Suspense (skeleton). UNEXPECTED failures — a row crashing on malformed data despite validation (a shape the schema missed, a formatter throwing) — are contained by a per-row (or per-visible-region) error boundary so one bad row shows a compact 'row failed to render' cell while the rest of the table stays fully usable, with resetKeys on the row id so navigating/editing recovers; an app-level boundary is the last resort. The division: operation failures (network, validation) are states with designed recovery UX; render crashes are boundary-contained bugs. Test plan by level: (1) pure/fast — the reducer (assert every transition and that illegal states can't be built; exhaustiveness), plus validators — no DOM needed. (2) behavioral (Testing Library + MSW) — edit a row and save (assert the row shows saved data via findBy*), save-failure path (assert inline error + preserved draft + retry works), bulk-delete (select rows, confirm, assert they're gone or the failure message shows), and the fetch-race if rows refetch (deterministic mock ordering per Unit 9). (3) a deliberate malformed-row test — feed the table a row that crashes rendering and assert the error boundary's fallback appears for THAT row while sibling rows still render (containment verified, not hoped). Mock only network (MSW) and any external SDK; run the real reducer, real rows, real boundaries. Coverage check: types make illegal row states/actions uncompilable and validate external data; modeled states handle expected failures with recovery; boundaries contain unexpected crashes; tests assert user-visible behavior at every level and prove the containment. Each of the unit's three tools covers what the others can't — types prevent, tests detect, boundaries contain.",
            "explanation": "The unit's capstone: types (prevent illegal states + validate boundaries), tests (behavioral, boundary-mocked, per-level), and error handling (modeled states for expected failures, boundaries for unexpected crashes) composed into one feature's robustness strategy — integrated with Unit 4's state machines and Unit 9's async. The grader rewards the expected/unexpected division and a test plan that asserts behavior and containment, not internals.",
