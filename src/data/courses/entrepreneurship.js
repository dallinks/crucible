    "The disciplined, evidence-based founder's path from a raw idea to a scalable company — anchored in MIT's Disciplined Entrepreneurship, Lean Startup, and Customer Development. The judgment is graded against operator rubrics, not multiple choice.",
  overview:
    "Startups rarely die because the product could not be built. They die because nobody wanted it, because the economics of selling it never worked, or because the company scaled before either question was answered. Entrepreneurship, as this course teaches it, is the discipline of attacking those risks in the right order: treating a company as a stack of hypotheses — about the customer, the pain, the product, the channel, the economics — and testing the deadliest ones first with evidence rather than confidence.\n\nThe course is anchored in the canon that professionalized the field — MIT's Disciplined Entrepreneurship, Steve Blank's Customer Development, the Lean Startup, Crossing the Chasm, and the Y Combinator playbook — and rests on four pillars. **Market first**: segment, choose a beachhead, and size it bottom-up before building anything. **Evidence over opinion**: get out of the building, and run interviews and experiments that can falsify the plan. **Unit economics**: a business is viable when CAC, LTV, and payback say so, not when the pitch deck does. **Staged scaling**: what wins early adopters is not what crosses the chasm, and premature scaling is the classic self-inflicted death.\n\nThe arc follows the order in which a real venture must de-risk. Units 1–3 find and validate the market: customers and the beachhead, the value proposition and MVP, and customer development. Units 4–6 make the machine work: business model and unit economics, go-to-market and sales, growth and retention. Units 7–9 build the company around it: fundraising and financing, team and execution, strategy and moats.\n\nThere is little here to memorize and much to judge, so the gates are graded by an operator's rubric: specific, customer-grounded, quantified reasoning scores; buzzwords and top-down hand-waving do not. By the end you should be able to take a raw idea and produce the artifacts an investor or cofounder would take seriously — a defended beachhead choice, a bottom-up market size, a testable value proposition, an honest unit-economics model, and a staged go-to-market plan.",

Grade like an investor or operator who has seen these mistakes a thousand times: reward specific, evidence-based, customer-grounded reasoning and correct use of the frameworks (beachhead market, jobs-to-be-done, TAM/SAM/SOM, unit economics); penalize vague generalities, buzzwords, top-down hand-waving, and answers that dodge the hard question.

      summary: "Pick a beachhead, know exactly who the customer is, and size the market from the bottom up.",
      intro: "The course begins where the evidence says startups actually live or die: the market. Before any product exists, the discipline is choosing whom to serve — segmenting the possible markets, picking a single beachhead you can dominate rather than a broad market you can only wave at, and defining the customer concretely enough (persona, end user, economic buyer) that every later decision has a referee. The unit closes with bottom-up market sizing: TAM, SAM, and SOM built from countable units — customers times price — rather than top-down analyst percentages. These three lessons are the foundation every later unit assumes: the value proposition of Unit 2 is designed for this customer, and the unit economics of Unit 4 are computed on this market. The gate grades specificity; 'everyone who eats' fails it.",

CB Insights' running analysis of why startups die puts *\"no market need\"* at or near the top, cited in roughly 35–42% of cases, ahead of running out of cash or being out-competed. The implication is sharp: your dominant risk is **market risk**, not technical risk. So the first discipline of building a company isn't the product — it's deciding *who, exactly, the customer is and why their need is urgent.* Everything downstream — the product, the pricing, the pitch — is a consequence of that choice. The cardinal sin is the opposite instinct: defining the market broadly (\"everyone who eats\", \"all small businesses\") because breadth feels ambitious. Breadth is, in fact, usually fatal."

Then one paid acquisition ultimately yields 1/(1 − r) customers, so the **effective** cost per customer is (1 − r) times the paid cost. As the segment's internal connectedness r rises toward 1, effective CAC collapses toward zero.",
              "proof": "One paid customer refers r customers in the first generation; those refer r·r = r² in the second; and so on. The total number of customers seeded by the single paid acquisition is the geometric series\n\n  1 + r + r² + r³ + ⋯ = Σ_{k=0}^{∞} rᵏ = 1/(1 − r),  which converges because 0 ≤ r < 1.\n\nIf the paid acquisition costs C, it is amortized over 1/(1 − r) customers, so the effective cost per acquired customer is\n\n  CAC_eff = C / (1/(1 − r)) = C·(1 − r).\n\nIn a diffuse market r ≈ 0 and CAC_eff ≈ C; in a tightly networked beachhead with r = 0.5, CAC_eff is halved; at r = 0.8 it is one-fifth of the paid cost. ∎\n\nThis is the same geometric-series engine behind the viral coefficient (Unit 6). **Homogeneity is precisely what makes r large** — which is why a tightly connected beachhead is cheaper to win than a scattered market of the same size."

Writing ARPU = (1/N) Σⱼ spendⱼ for the mean gives Σⱼ spendⱼ = N · ARPU, hence TAM = N · ARPU. For a partition into disjoint segments the outer sum splits over segments, TAM = Σᵢ Σ_{j∈i} spendⱼ = Σᵢ Nᵢ · ARPUᵢ — so you may (and should) size a mixed market segment by segment and add. SAM and SOM are by definition the serviceable fraction s and obtainable fraction σ of that revenue, so they multiply through. ∎\n\nThe additivity is the practical payoff: it licenses sizing each homogeneous sub-segment with its own ARPU instead of forcing one blended average over a market that isn't uniform."

Switching also costs time, risk, and change-management, which buyers price in as a required margin of safety; empirically this lands around a 3–10× ratio, i.e. P ≤ V/3 makes the decision an easy \"yes.\" Since V = Q · v scales with the size of the problem, the *same* product is worth more to a customer with larger Q — which is precisely why you target the segment that feels the pain most acutely (the beachhead from Unit 1). Cost-plus pricing ignores V entirely and leaves money on the table when V ≫ cost, or prices you out when V is small. ∎"

      summary: "Get out of the building, run honest interviews and experiments, and decide when to pivot or persevere.",
      intro: "A value proposition and an MVP are hypotheses; this unit is the discipline of testing them against reality — Customer Development, in Steve Blank's phrase 'getting out of the building.' You will learn to run interviews that produce evidence instead of politeness, following the Mom Test rules: ask about past behavior, never pitch, never ask 'would you buy it?'. You will design cheap experiments with pass/fail criteria committed in advance, and — the hardest lesson — make the pivot-or-persevere decision on the evidence rather than on sunk cost and founder hope. This validation loop is the engine the rest of the course assumes is running: the economics of Unit 4 and the go-to-market of Unit 5 are only as good as the evidence feeding them.",

The third lesson delivers the course's most counterintuitive warning: with bad unit economics or high churn, growth accelerates death, and scale is the murder weapon.

      summary: "The AARRR funnel, why retention is the foundation, and the engines of growth — sticky, viral, and paid.",
      intro: "Acquisition through one channel gets you started; this unit is the machinery of compounding. The AARRR funnel — acquisition, activation, retention, referral, revenue — gives the whole customer journey a measurable spine, and the unit's central claim is that retention is its foundation: a leaky bucket makes every upstream effort pointless, which is why retention cohorts, not signup counts, are the first chart a serious operator reads. From there, the engines of growth — sticky, viral, and paid — each with its governing metric (churn, the viral coefficient, CAC payback), and the honest math of virality that almost no product achieves. Unit 4's economics reappear here as the constraint every engine must satisfy. The gate asks you to diagnose funnels, not recite their letters.",

In AARRR terms the leak isn't Acquisition; it's Activation and Retention.

      intro: "With a working machine, the question becomes fuel: whether to raise outside capital at all, and on what terms. This unit starts with the fork most founders skip — bootstrapping versus venture, and the power-law logic that makes VCs need outcomes founders may not — then walks the stages from pre-seed onward and the cap-table mechanics: dilution round by round, option pools that come out of the founders' side, and SAFEs converting at caps. Term sheets close the unit: liquidation preferences, anti-dilution, and board control — the clauses that decide what founders actually keep, worked through numerically rather than described. Unit 4's unit economics are your negotiating leverage here; the gate makes you run the cap-table math and read a term sheet like an operator.",

If a fraction of bets go to zero and only the top one or two produce nearly all the proceeds, then to hit M·F the fund needs at least one outcome on the order of M·F itself — here ~$300M of value created from a single position. An investment that, even if wildly successful, could only ever be worth (say) $20M cannot move a $100M fund and so is **un-fundable by that VC**, regardless of how good a business it is. Hence VCs select for the *ceiling* of an outcome — \"could this be a $1B company?\" — not for its expected value or its odds of modest success. ∎\n\nThis is why a solid, likely-profitable business can be a poor *venture* investment: VC math rewards a small chance of an enormous outcome over a high chance of a good one."

A heavily lopsided split among active co-founders is corrosive — it tells the 10% partner they're really an employee, which kills the motivation you most need from them and seeds exactly the co-founder conflict that so often destroys startups. For two people contributing comparably going forward, a near-equal split best aligns incentives for the long, hard road; a meaningful gap should reflect a genuinely large difference in commitment, role, capital, or risk, agreed openly rather than imposed by whoever spoke first. Separately, and independent of the split, all founder equity should vest — typically four years with a one-year cliff — so equity is earned through continued contribution: if the 'idea' founder (or anyone) leaves after six months, they don't keep a huge unearned stake, which protects the company and the remaining team.",

      intro: "The closing unit lifts to strategy: assuming the machine works, what stops someone better-funded from copying it — and how hard should you press the accelerator? Porter's five forces give the structural map of where profit survives; the moat catalog — network effects, switching costs, scale economies, brand — sorts durable advantage from mere head starts, with the sober warning that most early 'moats' are neither. The final lesson weighs blitzscaling against sustainable growth: when winner-take-most dynamics justify prioritizing speed over efficiency, and when Unit 4's economics say that same choice is suicide. As the course's synthesis it draws on everything — segmentation, economics, funding — and the gate asks for strategic judgment defended with the numbers.",

There are n choices for the first endpoint and n − 1 for the second, giving n(n − 1) ordered pairs; each connection is counted twice (once per ordering), so the number of distinct pairs is n(n − 1)/2. As n → ∞ this is Θ(n²). If value ∝ n(n − 1)/2, then a network of size 2n enables (2n)(2n − 1)/2 ≈ 4 · n(n − 1)/2 connections — about 4× the value. ∎\n\n**Gate:** n = 6 ⟹ 6 · 5 / 2 = **15** possible connections. The super-linear (quadratic) growth is *why* network-effect markets tip toward a single winner: each new user widens the leader's value advantage faster than linearly, making the network self-reinforcing and very hard to dislodge — and why winning such a market quickly can be decisive (next lesson).

There the prize is the whole market plus durability, so trading efficiency and risk for *being first* is rational; losing the scale race means losing everything. **A mistake** in markets *without* winner-take-all dynamics: if being bigger doesn't make you structurally safer, blitzscaling just burns capital and piles on risk with no moat to show for it, leaving the over-extended company vulnerable to a downturn or a leaner competitor. Most businesses should scale sustainably and let unit economics pace growth; blitzscaling is a specialized tool, not a default."

                  "solution": "Because network-effect value grows ~quadratically with users, the largest network is disproportionately the most valuable and most attractive to the next user — so the market *tips* to whoever reaches critical scale first, and that lead compounds into a moat. When the structure makes 'first to scale' equal to 'winner,' speed itself becomes the strategy: it's worth accepting inefficiency and burn to win the race, because the reward is the entire market and a durable, self-reinforcing advantage. Absent such tipping dynamics, there's no winner-take-all prize to justify the inefficiency, and sustainable scaling is better."

              "Popularity isn't defensibility: a product people love today can be cloned tomorrow by a faster or better-funded competitor, and being 'more popular' or 'better' stops protecting you the moment someone matches your features. A moat is what makes it hard for a competitor to take your customers even when their product is just as good. For a marketplace, the strongest candidate is the network effect through liquidity: more buyers attract more sellers and more sellers attract more buyers, so once a marketplace reaches critical mass it becomes self-reinforcing and very hard to dislodge — a thin competing marketplace offers neither side enough to switch. On top of that, a marketplace can build switching costs (accumulated reputation, reviews, and history that don't transfer), economies of scale (better pricing, logistics, or fraud control at volume), brand and trust, and proprietary data (matching, pricing, and recommendation models that improve with usage). The strategic priority is to engineer those effects — drive one category or geography to liquidity fast — rather than rely on popularity, which any competitor can attack.",

              "Blitzscaling means deliberately prioritizing speed over efficiency — accepting burn, inefficiency, and risk — to capture a market before competitors can. It's the right strategy when two conditions hold together: the market is winner-take-most, usually because of strong network effects or other first-scaler-wins dynamics so that the first company to reach critical scale becomes nearly unassailable; and the underlying unit economics can plausibly work once that scale is reached, so the burn buys a durable, defensible position worth paying for. It's reckless when those conditions are absent. If there's no network effect or winner-take-most dynamic, racing ahead just spends faster without building any moat — a fast follower can still win. And if the unit economics are negative, blitzscaling multiplies the per-unit losses (exactly as in the unit-economics unit) and accelerates death rather than dominance. So blitzscale only when winning the land-grab creates real defensibility and the economics can converge at scale; otherwise grow sustainably and let the reckless competitors burn themselves out.",
